I am a doctoral student in Psychology at the University of Oregon, and am passionate about data science, where Psychology, Data Analysis / Statistics, and Computer Science meet. My research interests include moral development and data literacy. In line with these interests, I&#8217;m also involved with efforts to increase data management literacy through the Science Library at the U. of Oregon.
