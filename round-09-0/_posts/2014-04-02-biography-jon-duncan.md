I am a Post Doctoral Research Associate in watershed ecohydrology at the University of North Carolina, where I recently finished my PhD. I study issues of streamflow generation and water quality genesis across a range of spatial and temporal scales. I use a combination of field work, statistical analysis, and spatially distributed numerical modeling.
