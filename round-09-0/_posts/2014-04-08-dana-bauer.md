I&#8217;m a developer and community advocate with the Developer Relations Group at Rackspace. My team builds the tools that make OpenStack and the Rackspace Cloud easy to use for developers. I also focus on outreach to open source communities. I&#8217;m an organizer with the Philadelphia Python User Group, an instructor with Girl Develop It, and a passionate supporter of diverse technical communities. I have a background in geography, science writing, math and chemistry.
