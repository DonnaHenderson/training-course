I am PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia in Biological Oceanography. My thesis work focuses on the changes that take place in marine viral communities over time and space using high-throughput sequencing. I&#8217;m still pretty new to programming but enjoy using and learning more about R, Python and the shell in my day-to-day work.
