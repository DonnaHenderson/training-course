world_cup = {&#8216;favorites': [&#8216;Brazil&#8217;, &#8216;Spain&#8217;, &#8216;Germany&#8217;], &#8216;host': &#8216;Brazil&#8217;, &#8216;months': [&#8216;June&#8217;,&#8217;July&#8217;] }  
list\_to\_print=\[world\_cup [&#8216;months&#8217;\] \[0\], world\_cup \[&#8216;host&#8217;\] \[1\], world_cup \[&#8216;favorites&#8217;\] \[2\]]

Question 1:

What is the value of *list\_to\_print*?

A. [ [&#8216;June&#8217;, &#8216;July&#8217;], &#8216;Brazil&#8217;, [&#8216;Brazil&#8217;, &#8216;Spain&#8217;, &#8216;Germany&#8217;] ]

D. [ &#8216;J&#8217;, &#8216;r&#8217;, &#8216;a&#8217; ]

Question 2

Define a new dictionary S*ummer_2014*. *Summer_2014* should have two keys. One key should be named &#8216;sports&#8217; and the value of the key should be the dictionary *world_cup *(as defined in question 1). A second key should be named &#8216;number\_of\_months&#8217; and the value should be the integer 3.
