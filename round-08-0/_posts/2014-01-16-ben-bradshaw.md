Hello all!  I am a systems administrator for the GTECH corporation in Austin, TX.  My background is in web application development and database administration.  I have been a programmer in some form for 2/3rds of my life.  My goal is both to improve my coding skills through the synthesis of teaching, and improve the world by working for scientists.
