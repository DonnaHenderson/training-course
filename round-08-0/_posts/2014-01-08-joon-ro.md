I am a PhD Candidate in Marketing (Quantitative) at the University of Texas at Austin. My main research interest is using empirical models to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing strategies in various settings such as durable goods and entertainment consumption.

I am enthusiastic about learning and teaching scientific computing. This is my second instructor training and I am excited about improving my teaching skills!
