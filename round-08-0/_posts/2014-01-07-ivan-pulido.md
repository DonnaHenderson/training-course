I&#8217;m an undergrad physics student at the National University of Colombia in Bogot√°, where I also work as a system administrator. I&#8217;m interested in computational physics, specifically in numerical solutions and simulations for quantum mechanics. I have programming experience with languages such as C/C++, python and bash and I have good skills with administrating Linux systems.
