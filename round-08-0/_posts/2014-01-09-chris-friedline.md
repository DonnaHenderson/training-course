I am currently a postdoc at Virginia Commonwealth University working with Andrew Eckert.  My NSF-funded project involves understanding the genetic architecture and evolution of the fire-adapted, thick-bark phenotype in economically-important pine species throughout the southeastern US.  I also have a masters in bioinformatics and eight years of industry experience as a systems architect, engineer, and administrator.
