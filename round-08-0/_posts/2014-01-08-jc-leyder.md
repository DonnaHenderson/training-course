I am a Research Fellow at the [European Space Agency][1] (ESA), working at the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) located in Spain. I study massive stars, most often using X-ray and gamma-ray observations. I am interested in teaching as well as in public outreach, and I&#8217;m excited to get the opportunity to improve my skills and help out others!
