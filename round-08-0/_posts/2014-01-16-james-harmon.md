I&#8217;m an Android developer living in the Chicago area. The app I&#8217;m currently working on uses an Android tablet as the front end for some industrial equipment. 

Helping others learn has always been part of my job and something I enjoy doing. For some of my career I&#8217;ve even been a full time trainer. However, I&#8217;m a self-taught trainer so my education was by trial and error. I&#8217;m looking forward to developing an understanding of the principles behind learning so that I can improve the way I teach.

I&#8217;ve been following the activities of Software Carpentry for a couple of years and am super excited to finally being involved.
