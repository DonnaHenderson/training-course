I chose the following concept map: http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/03/26/concept-map-simulation-in-r-noble/

**Novice vs. Competent practitioner**

1. What is the advantage of doing simulations in R?

2. How would you know the best way to extract your parameters before and after simulation?

&nbsp;

**Competent practitioner vs. Expert**

1. What is the difference between a simulation that yields parameters &#8216;very close&#8217; from the ones you created to another one that yields the &#8216;exact&#8217; created parameters?

2. In case you want to share your code, how can you always have the same model output even though you are using random numbers?
