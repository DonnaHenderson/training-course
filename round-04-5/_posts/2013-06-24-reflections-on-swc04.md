## Reflections on SWC {#reflections-on-swc}

I enjoyed the software carpentry teaching course. Particularly I enjoyed having to more formally think about what worked and didn&#8217;t work in teaching; confronting this seems like a good way of improving teaching in general. I didn&#8217;t know what to expect coming in &#8212; especially focussing on syllabus issues vs teaching style &#8212; but I&#8217;m glad we focussed on *how* to teach, rather than *what* to teach (which really reflects the aim of SWC itself I guess; principles over rote).

### Round 4.1: Concept maps {#round-4.1-concept-maps}

I did this while travelling to see family over Christmas, so it was really crammed into the space that I had. But it was a fun exercise, and I felt I learnt a lot about stopping to think about the logical order to present things in.

### Round 4.2: Assessment questions {#round-4.2-assessment-questions}

This was designed as an extension of the concept map round, and it really felt that way. I feel I learnt more about how knowlege and skills are likely to accumulate over time (and the expert blind spot) than about actually assessing people.

### Round 4.3: Presentations from Facts and Fallacies {#round-4.3-presentations-from-facts-and-fallacies}

I found the book to be a bit of a slog, primarily because of the writing style. However, there was lots of good stuff in it that applies much more broadly than software engineering (especially estimation: that applies to pretty much any biological project I&#8217;ve seen or been involved in). I think that many fields could benefit from an honest appraisal of their accumulated folklore. Making slides was a pain, but they always are. Being compelled to do so made me realise how much I avoid doing so now in both research presentations (series of figures/pictures/photos, perhaps with a title) or teaching (whiteboard/webpage).

### Round 4.4: Videos {#round-4.4-videos}

This took an lot of time, and I found it super awkward. Even with other people in the room, it wasn&#8217;t really possible to generate the energy and feeling of a usual teaching environment. I&#8217;m honestly not sure how much the two methods (videos/real life) are related. At the same time, it was good to get an outside-in view on style, and my whirlwind hands. But perhaps that could be got by filming part of the next week&#8217;s session and reviewing that.

### Round 4.5: Reflections on teaching {#round-4.5-reflections-on-teaching}

This was probably my favourite excercise. Because I was going to be teaching anyway, it felt very natural and less forced. The [blog post][1] on that is up now. Reflecting on the teaching was useful, and we&#8217;ve been trying to do that through the course so far; this was a nice way of more formally capturing that.

### Other comments {#other-comments}

I thought that the blog worked well as a medium of communication. However, it was often hard to see the posts together (especially when round 5 started and the few posts from round 4 started getting lost in the noise). Keeping track of what was commented on felt harder than necessary too.

The running feeling I have through all my reflections on SWC was "where is the time going to come from". Teaching is already seen to some degree as a distraction from the "true" job of a post-doc (cranking out papers), and finding the balance was a continued struggle.

It was fun to be able to see the different assignments from previous streams, and see what was common and what had been dropped and replaced. I suspect that there could be something interesting to be learnt from understanding the reasons for changing the course (which were to replace things that didn&#8217;t really work, which were a whim, and which were to move with the way a group is naturally going), especially with a group of people interested in developing their own courses.

I was grateful for the flexibility in scheduling, and there is no way I would have completed some of the assignments in time. At the same time, there were a number of times where I wasn&#8217;t sure when the next meeting was, complicated by the fact that Australia is usually on a different day to Canada/US. An evolving blog post might be easier than digging through email chains for keeping track of scheduling?
