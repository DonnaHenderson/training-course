I am a freelance developer in .NET environment (VB and C#) for more than 9 years. By publishing two books about AutoCAD (in Arabic) and working in a construction company as a drafter for 9 years, I assume I am an expert in CAD systems. right now I am interested in developing add-ins for AutoCAD through VB, C# and python if possible.
