My undergraduate & graduate background is in education, psychology, and linguistics.  I&#8217;ve been working in the fields of education & nonprofit management for the past 15 years or so, and have taught myself software programming and data management/analysis.

I split my time between mothering a toddler, working as a programmer in VBA & SQL (MS Access), and hobby projects, mainly in Python.  I&#8217;m also very interested in GIS.  I&#8217;ve been teaching Intro to Python workshops in Philadelphia for the past few years and was a helper at a Software Carpentry workshop this summer.

I&#8217;m really excited to combine my background in education with my experience in programming & data analysis to develop technology curricula.
