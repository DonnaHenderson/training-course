I am currently a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Oxford. My appointment is joint with the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School and the Oxford Mathematical Institute.  My primary fields of research are numerical/computational methods and agent-based/multi-agent systems modeling. I have a MSc and PhD in economics from the University of Edinburgh, and a BSc in applied mathematics from the College of William and Mary.

During my PhD at the University of Edinburgh I taught several courses in computational and simulation methods to graduate and doctoral students as part of the Scottish Graduate Programme in Economics (SGPE). I continue to teach these courses and I hope to expand both their scope and content over the next few years.

I have had no formal training in either teaching or software development so I am really excited to be participating in this course. I look forward to meeting and working with all of you!
