Hi everyone! I am a researcher in computational chemistry at KTH Stockholm and application expert at the PDC Center forÂ High Performance Computing. My work evolves around developing and supporting quantum chemistry software mainly using Fortran, C, C++, and Python. I am interested in using, sharing, and teaching modern collaborative tools and workflows and made first contact with the SC as local tutor during SC Stockholm. I am looking forward to learn more about learning and teaching and to help with the SC initiative.
