Hi,

I am a PostDoc in Neuroscience and a Data Science fellow at UC Berkeley. My research is on how sensory information is encoded in the brain. I use machine learning approaches to fit computational models to neuroimaging data. Before joining UCB, I was in Berlin, Germany for my PhD in Neuroscience and in Munich for my MSc in CS. I also worked as a database administrator for unix systems. I primarily use python to analyze and visualize my research data (used previously Matlab).
