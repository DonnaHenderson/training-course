I&#8217;m a theoretical ecologist working on the problem of regime shifts and uncertainty in ecological management and conservation. I am currently a post-doc at UC Santa Cruz, where I am developing optimal control approaches to fisheries management that are robust to deep model uncertainty and regime shifts.  I am also interested in how methods from informatics and data science may help us bring more and varied data to bear on these problems.

&nbsp;

I&#8217;m a member and co-founder of [ropensci][1], a developer collective promoting open and reproducible science in the R computational environment.  I keep an [open lab notebook][2] and have done a few [interviews][3] sharing my perspective on open science issues. You can find me on [Twitter][4], [Github][5], and other web habitat under my screen name, cboettig.
