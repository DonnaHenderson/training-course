hi I&#8217;m Walter, an artist and educator based in Wellington, New Zealand. I work as a lecturer in Media Design at Victoria University of Wellington&#8217;s School of Design, where I currently teach Physical Computing, Internet Design and the Introduction to Game Design papers. Also I supervise two MDI (postgrad) research streams dubbed &#8216;Data.Mine&#8217; (experimental data gathering and representation) and &#8216;Networked Performance&#8217;.

My background is in Fine Arts, also in terms of teaching experience as I was previously working at a Liberal Arts College in the Netherlands. Most of my personal work and research revolves around contemporary digital cultures and Internet related topics, some (slightly dated) outputs of which you can find at [http://moddr.net][1]

I am a strong advocate of using open source methodologies in my teaching and general approach to learning, which translates to using Free Software and Open Hardware in my courses predominantly. I am also currently pursuing a Master degree in Higher Education Teaching and Learning at Victoria University, which I hope might tie in nicely with the Software Carpentry course and approach. Looking FWD!
