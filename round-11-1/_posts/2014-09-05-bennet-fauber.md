I am a linux system administrator and provide computing support at the University of Michigan. My academic degree is in history, and most of my work experience is with statistical computing support. I have been teaching workshops on computing and statistical software since 1992. My primary teaching and support concern is providing support and encouragement to people with nontechnical backgrounds.
