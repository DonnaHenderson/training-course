I am a computer consultant in the UK with over 30 years of industrial experience delivering complex mission critical systems. My role is primarily as a solution architect although I have extensive experience in all aspects of the development life cycle. I graduated last century in Computer Science and Maths from the University of Manchester and more than 10 years later I obtained a Master&#8217;s degree in Mathematical Modelling. I am a chartered engineer, a chartered IT professional and a fellow of the BCS. My company has recognised me as a Technical Expert and I look after our open source software (OSS) strategy.

For the last few years I have been delivering workshops in schools as a volunteer to pupils aged 8 to 16 introducing programming using languages such as Scratch, Python or Java, normally using my own material and often using the Raspberry PI. I enjoy sharing my experience with those embarking on a new challenge (programming) and I am sure that this course will provide some great insights in improving the learning experience.
