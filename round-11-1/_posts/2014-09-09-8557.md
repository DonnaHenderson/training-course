Hi, everyone,

I am currently doing my MASc in Electrical Engineering at UofT. For my graduate study, I Â often have to work with large set of simulation and laboratory measurements using data-processing toolbox like Matlab, Python, and other scripting languages. Besides, I also enjoy teaching simple computing techniques to people from non-technical background.

Thanks, Alif
