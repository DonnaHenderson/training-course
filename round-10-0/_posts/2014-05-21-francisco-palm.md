Hi everybody, I teach (and learn) operations research and simulation at the University of The Andes, MÃ©rida, Venezuela. I&#8217;ve been Python activist for 10 years, and Venezuela Python community founder. I have a Masters Degree in Applied Mathematics for Engineering and a Advanced Studies Diploma in Cartography, GIS and Remote Sensing.

I have taught python programming to children between 8 and 9 years old and Phds in physics. I have also offered R in my classes of stochastic processes.

I am a follower/fan of Software Carpentry project since 2008, I have strong beliefs in its utility an its potential for saving the world of programming. I also think that many of the ideas are applicable to the development of non-scientific applications, but scientists seem to be less stubborn <img src="http://localhost:8080/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" class="wp-smiley" />

I am happily married, three kids, practice for open waters swimming and I am starting in Yoga. I like geek stuff and Indie music.
