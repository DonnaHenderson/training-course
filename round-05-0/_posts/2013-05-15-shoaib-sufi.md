I am a project manager with a technical slant working at the [myGrid][1] group at the School of Computer Science, University of Manchester. I also work as Community Manager at the [Software Sustainability Institute][2]. I have taught at one software carpentry boot camp in the UK (University of Oxford, Doctoral Training Centre in May 2013). It was a bit [seat of the pants][3]Â and although I have my own ideas on how it could be improved the next time I instruct, I think being part of the study group would really help me to improve my practice.
