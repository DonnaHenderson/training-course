I&#8217;m an open source hacker and data architect at Mozilla working on the software that analyzes Firefox crashes. I have 19 years of experience in systems administration and software development. I started a PyLadies group in Portland,Â  teach free classes to adult women and am reaching out to local K-12 teachers, trying to pick their brains and get better at teaching.
