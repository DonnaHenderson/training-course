I have a PhD in Physics and work as a researcher. At work I do numerical simulations to model the quantum physics of electrons in solids. Most of my programming is in C++, but Python is taking an increasingly important role lately. I&#8217;ve being following SC blog since a couple of years ago, and learning lots from it, before deciding to become an instructor.
