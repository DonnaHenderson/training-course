I am getting my PhD in Bioinformatics at the University of California, San Diego, and I study <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhancer_(genetics)" target="_blank">enhancers</a> and their role in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell" target="_blank">immune cell</a> type specification. Prior to starting my PhD, I spent several years in web development and software engineering, where I learned to love Python, git, and writing code that will make sense to the guy who takes over when I leave.
