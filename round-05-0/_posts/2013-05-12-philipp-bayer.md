I&#8217;m a Bioinformatics PhD student at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia, where I specialize on plant genomics. Specifically, I am using genetic variations to help improve plant breeding of rapeseed and to improve the quality of plant genomes. On the side, I&#8217;m also interested in open (medical) data: I&#8217;m the co-founder of openSNP.org, a repository for people to upload and annotate genotypings so that scientists around the world can use it for free.
