I&#8217;m a programmer and data scientist living in Montréal, Canada. I have a M.Sc in computer science from [McGill University][1] where I studied quantum computing, and I&#8217;ve been working as a programmer for the last 2 years. Recently I&#8217;ve been teaching intro to programming workshops with [Montréal Python][2] and I&#8217;d like to get better at teaching beginners how to program.
