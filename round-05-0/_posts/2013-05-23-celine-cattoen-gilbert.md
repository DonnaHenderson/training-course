I am an application support consultant at BlueFern, University of Canterbury, NZ. My background is in applied mathematics and I enjoy working on optimisation and Â parallelisation of algorithm in a wide range of scientific problems. I am interested in high level languages such as Matlab/Octave and Python that enable prototyping of research problems and how to port them in an HPC environment trying to keep a balance between efficiency of interpreted languages and speed of prototyping much larger problems. The main part of my work is to make HPC more accessible to researchers, which can range from making their workflow easier, advising and consulting on HPC techniques, benchmarking, visualisation, to consultations on optimisation and parallelisation of prototype algorithms.
