Unfortunately, I missed last week, and while I think the video is OK, it&#8217;s 1) too long and 2) a bit off-mark for motivational. The focus is more on the demo. That said, I think it does a credible job of showing how the Chrome debugger could make your life easier in the face of understanding the complexity of browser-side programming. And, I&#8217;ve spent more time on this than I really have to spend already&#8230;

I was thinking more of folks like y&#8217;all who are somewhat advanced and would know what most of the core concepts are &#8211; JavaScript, debuggers, asynchronous programming, etc.



**Demotivation**

As a graduate student I took a class in text mining using Scala. I had actually done some enterprise java programming between grad school and grad school [sic], and this course dropped me right back in the deep end and reminded me why I hated Java. There is no drive towards consensus in the community, there are many solutions even for trivial things (like simple operations on strings), and I&#8217;d been out of the loop long enough that I knew I&#8217;d need to learn that space all over again. On top of this, I was using a library that was severely affected by problems in using dynamic containers with static types. And there was no direction to resources to help us navigate this pre-requisite step.

I really wanted to learn this stuff, but I was busy, the chore was unpleasant, and I had no colleagues to go through it with me. I dropped the course. (Though now that I have more time, I&#8217;m trying to help popularize some of the tools developed out of that class!)
