I didn&#8217;t introduce myself.  I figured with 3 minutes I would cut straight to the content.

## Demotivating Experience

The most recent demotivational experience I had actually wasn&#8217;t related to academia, but I do think it relates to software carpentry.  I&#8217;ve been working on a project in my spare time for the past 4 years.  Specifically, it&#8217;s a video game.  I spent the first 3 years writing the game&#8217;s engine in .net code.  I used a library called Mogre (managed wrapper for the popular Ogre 3d library).  As I pushed the boundaries of Mogre, I found that I needed features which were available in Ogre but not yet wrapped in Mogre.  I decided I would set out to find an automated way to write my own managed wrapper for Ogre.  Naturally I stumbled on SWIG which seemed to be everything I ever needed.  When I started trying to use SWIG, I spent a lot of time in the user manual.  I slowly realized that SWIG wasn&#8217;t what I thought it was.  After realizing that I would have to write simple interfaces by hand, I was completely demotivated.  I thought the entire purpose of SWIG was to automate, but it didn&#8217;t seem like that was the case.
