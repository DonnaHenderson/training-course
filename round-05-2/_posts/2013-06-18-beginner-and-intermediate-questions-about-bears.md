I decided to post some fun questions about bears&#8230; since the questions could be on any topic. Â Note: I am not an expert on bears, but I do love pandas.

**Novice:**

Which of the following is not a species of bear?

a) Arctos (Grizzly)

b) Maritimus (Polar)

c) Fulgens (Red Panda)

d) All of the above are bears

**Intermediate:**

The proper response to a provoked bear attack is to:

a) play dead; get into a defensive, prone posture and do not fight back.

b) run, the bear will likely not give chase

c) fight back, throw things at the bear, yell

d) toss your backpack or anything you are carrying to distract the bear; try to look bigger and assert dominance
