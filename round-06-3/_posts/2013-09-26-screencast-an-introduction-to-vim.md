My third take, based on Amanda Charbonneau&#8217;s helpful [concept map][1] from Round 6.1.

<!-- copy and paste. Modify height and width if desired. -->

I wanted to experience of converting relatively simple text to video, but basic Vim is not the most visually stimulating topic, and I ended up creating my own set of written bullet points first since presenting audio and visual simultaneously is quite different (this was relatively quick, and I could have taught from these in person). I first used vim when someone sat next to my laptop and said &#8220;Hey, did you know you can&#8230;&#8221;, which is hard to match for engagement. However, the video did have the advantage of making visual changes like moving between the editor and the command line, or a warning popping up a the bottom of the screen much easier to follow than on a printed page.
