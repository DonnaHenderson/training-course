Command line programs in unix-like operating systems typically print their standard output (STDOUT) and standard error (STDERR) streams to the terminal screen. This screencast provides a basic introduction on how to capture STDOUT and STDERR and redirect them to files. The intended audience for this screencast is novice-level users who need to know how to open a terminal window and how to enter commands but not much else.

I had originally intended to cover both pipes and redirection in the screencast but I decided that it was too much to cover at a reasonable pace in three minutes. I also decided to leave out redirection of standard input (STDIN) to programs because it is much less commonly encountered in the wild, at least by me. Â I hope I did not take the process of content reduction too far.

I know the audio is on the quiet side but I could not figure out how to adjust and my screencast was late enough as it was!
