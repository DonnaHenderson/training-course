Here&#8217;s a tutorial on initializing a git repo and walking through a simple development workflow using version control. Assumptions I made:

*   Assumed this was being taught at a software carpentry workshop sometime after the &#8216;Shell&#8217; module. I tried to reinforce some concepts from there and did not explain those commands.
*   Assumed that students knew what git and version control was and had git installed and configured on their local machines.

I put too much material in here (4min&#8230;). I wanted to leave students at a point where they&#8217;d have a general workflow, so cutting it any shorter felt wrong. If I were to make this again, I&#8217;d probably cut out the second file I made to make the tutorial a bit shorter.

Note: `echo "!!" > FILE` Will not work properly for *all* cases, but happened to work alright here.
