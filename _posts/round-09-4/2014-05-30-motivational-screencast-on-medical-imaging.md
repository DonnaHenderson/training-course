**An introduction to how medical imaging works.**



**Demotivating Experience**

When I was at school I had a &#8220;Science teacher&#8221; who when I asked why clothes were the colour they were, answered me with &#8220;because they just are&#8221;.  This was not the only question I asked where I got this answer.

Being 12 years old and very inquisitive, I found these answers extremely frustrating and as my parents knew nothing about Science, they couldn&#8217;t help either.  Hitting this brick wall was extremely frustrating and put me off Science in school.

What I wished the teacher had said was &#8220;well I don&#8217;t actually know but what you need to look for in the library is a simple book on chemistry and chemical bonds&#8221;.
