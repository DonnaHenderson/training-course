This is aimed to motivate people to learn how to create their own functions. (The background I had in mind was Biology Masters students learning R, but it should be more generally applicable.)

**Demotivation:**

I don&#8217;t tend to get demotivated, so it&#8217;s hard to think of a relevant example. If I think a general topic is interesting I&#8217;ll try to understand how it works and find out all I can about it. The best example I can think of was during undergrad, where there was one particular course (on ocean basin formation) which consisted of a lot of memorising facts and very little working things out. Sometimes I&#8217;m happy to learn facts, but I think in this case I didn&#8217;t see why I would want to know about basin formation as I didn&#8217;t find it particularly interesting. Also the lecturing wasnâ€™t very engaging; from memory it was mostly equations and few examples of how to use them or why we would want to use them.

I think with more of a focus on problem solving, especially in the practicals afterwards, if not in the lectures themselves then I probably would have found the course more interesting.
