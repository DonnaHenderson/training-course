Meeting of the Software Carpentry Instructors Study Group  
Round 5.1  
May 23/24, 2013

**Agenda**

*   Welcome
*   Goal is to give a quick overview of: 
    *   educational psychology
    *   instructional design
    *   how they relate to teaching programming
*   Structure: 
    *   Biweekly meetings like this one
    *   Posting and commenting on other people&#8217;s work
*   Homework due next Wednesday: 
    *   Pick a small topic (something that you can explain in 5-10 minutes)
    *   Draw a concept map (look at [previous rounds][1] for examples) 
        *   Should have about 6 bubbles and 10 connections (much more means your topic is too big)
        *   Make it readable, but don&#8217;t put too much effort into making it pretty
        *   Pen on paper plus a camera or scanner is good enough
    *   Give feedback on at least 2 other concept maps

**Notes**

Educational psychology

*   lots of science has been done

Instructional design

*   Even if we know how brains work, there are several methods for teaching
*   Akin to the relationship between science and engineering

How they relate to teaching programming

*   Many computer scientists don&#8217;t know that there are people who actually study how to teach programming and computer science
*   Few apply what&#8217;s known

Deep vs. shallow learning

*   Shallow learning: memorize and regurgitate information
*   Deep learning: understand principles, recognize when to apply them
*   Example: 
    *   You can learn to solve word problems in calculus without understanding calculus
    *   Pattern match the problem to an algorithm for computing an answer
    *   But if something goes wrong, you&#8217;re stuck
*   *Transference* is a sign of deep learning: being able to transfer knowledge from one problem to a related one
*   Students who don&#8217;t yet understand the concepts often ask questions that don&#8217;t make any sense. 
    *   Everyone has a set of conceptual categories they fit information into
    *   When encountering new information you cannot help but put it into old categories, even if they are wrong
    *   Transition from &#8220;not getting it&#8221; to &#8220;getting it&#8221; isn&#8217;t about quantity of information; it&#8217;s about developing the right conceptual model

Relationship to online learning

*   Misunderstanding happens in a million different ways because there are many possible wrong conceptual models
*   Good teachers determine what individuals misunderstand, and correct it
*   This is why recorded lectures (and &#8220;sage on the stage&#8221; lectures in general) aren&#8217;t particularly helpful to novices
*   And why Software Carpentry now uses in-person bootcamps instead of videos
*   It&#8217;s also why we can&#8217;t just point scientists at Stack Overflow 
    *   They don&#8217;t yet have the model or vocabulary to phrase a question sensibly, or recognize a useful answer.

Emotion and learning

*   Emotional attachment is very important to learning: if one part of the brain says &#8220;I don&#8217;t care&#8221;, other parts are unlikely to absorb information
*   Think about a typical boot camp: 
    *   First thing that happens to many people is installation problems
    *   This hurts motivation, and undermines their confidence in us and in themselves

Using concept maps in teaching

*   Use it to figure out structure of talk
*   Give learners the whole concept map at the start, they will doodle and expand
*   Draw concept map step by step as you teach
*   Get the learners to create a concept map so that you can check the mental model they&#8217;ve developed
