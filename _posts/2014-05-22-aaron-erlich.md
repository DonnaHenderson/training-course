Hi everyone! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science and affiliated with the Center for Statistics and Social Sciences as the University of Washington. I helped out at Software Carpentry&#8217;s training at the University of Washington and wanted to get involved with the cause. I am passionate about helping people make their research more replicable through scientific computing. Coming from the social sciences, I understand many of the barriers to entry for folks and am keen to help punch some holes in them, as I have had to do myself (in much harder fashion than necessary). I am currently in Tbilisi, Georgia running a small field experiment and survey for my dissertation, so may be calling in at weird hours.
