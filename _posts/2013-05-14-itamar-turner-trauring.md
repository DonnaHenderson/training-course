I&#8217;m a software engineer based in Cambridge, MA; I&#8217;ve been writing software professionally for 17 years now. Currently I&#8217;m doing part-time consulting building distributed systems using Twisted (a Python networking framework), and taking care of my young daughter the rest of the time. I&#8217;ve spent a little time thinking about how to teach some aspects of software engineering, e.g. tools that scientists I know were missing, so I&#8217;m happy Software Carpentry exists and that I may be able to contribute to it.
