This screencast walks through revising a table to emphasize its main result. I think this task matches our focus on competent versus expert performance. I wanted to use this screencast outside this course, so it&#8217;s longer than the requested time (5:45 instead of 3:30). 

The video conversion made the text hard to read. I recommend going to Youtube directly and watching it in full-screen mode: [Full Youtube version.][1] Can anyone recommend a way to get get Camtasia to export a better-quality version? It looks much clearer on my machine.

I chose to use a variety of annotations and highlights because the video is really just pointing to text on a page. I&#8217;m interested to hear which annotations worked for viewers and which ones didn&#8217;t.

I spent about eight hours doing the video, including writing the script, downloading and learning Camtasia, and editing the final product.
