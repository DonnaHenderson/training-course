Prof. [Mark Guzdial][1] (Georgia Tech) [blogs][2] frequently and intelligently about teaching computer science (and other things). Just today, for example, he reports on [an experiment from the 1930s][3] that's directly relevant to when and how we (should) teach programming. I've learned a lot of what I know about education starting from his posts, and I think everyone else could too.
