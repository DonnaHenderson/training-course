The more I've tried to teach online, the more sceptical I've become about what most educational technology startups are doing. Here are three well-informed articles that have influenced my thinking; if you have done any online courses or participated in any MOOCs, please describe your experiences (both positive and negative) as comments on this post.

1.  Scott Gray: "[My Thoughts on Codecademy][1]"
2.  Dan Meyer: "[What Silicon Valley Gets Wrong About Math Education Again and Again][2]"
3.  Stephen Downes: "[The Robot Teachers][3]"
