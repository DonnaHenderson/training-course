The more I&#8217;ve tried to teach online, the more sceptical I&#8217;ve become about what most educational technology startups are doing. Here are three well-informed articles that have influenced my thinking; if you have done any online courses or participated in any MOOCs, please describe your experiences (both positive and negative) as comments on this post.

1.  Scott Gray: &#8220;[My Thoughts on Codecademy][1]&#8220;
2.  Dan Meyer: &#8220;[What Silicon Valley Gets Wrong About Math Education Again and Again][2]&#8220;
3.  Stephen Downes: &#8220;[The Robot Teachers][3]&#8220;
