I just posted a fairly lengthy article on the Software Carpentry blog about [systematic curriculum design][1]â€”more precisely, about my ongoing efforts to reverse engineer a sensible structure for Software Carpentry from the content we have and the experience we've gained. The most useful guide to doing this that I've found is Wiggins & McTighe's *[Understanding by Design][2]*[][2], but it's not on the recommended reading for this study group because:

1.  it moves very slowly (though it's still better than most other books on education), and
2.  it assumes a course-in-a-classroom-with-a-test-at-the-end model of education, which isn't what we do.

Despite that, I like the model it describes:

1.  Figure out how you're going to assess what students have learned.
2.  Figure out what they need to learn in order to succeed on that assessment.
3.  Figure out an order to present those things that respects dependencies and gives them something they care about at every step.

I doubt we'll get far enough before Christmas to tackle this (we'll be hard-pressed to get through [the half-dozen goals I outlined earlier][3]), but if you want to dive into this more deeply, borrow a copy of Wiggins & McTighe and give it a skim.
