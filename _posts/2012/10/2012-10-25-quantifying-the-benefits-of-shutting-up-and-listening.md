Alex Reinhart just posted a very good summary of [what's wrong with the lecture model and how we can improve it][1] (long story short: listen to the students) that is sprinkled with lots of solid quantitative data. Please read, and think about when/how we could apply this to Software Carpentry. In particular, are there any experiments we could do with IPython Noteboks to explore these ideas?
