After a conversation last night with the instructors of an upcoming workshop, I realized that we really ought to start adding teaching tips to this blog, so I've created a category for it—please share one tip per post to keep things easier to index.

And to start things off:

***Use a web page to share code snippets with learners as you teach.***

Most of us now use live coding instead of slides—which is great, except that most of us type faster than our learners, so many of them fall behind (or are too busy transcribing what we've just done to pay attention to what we're saying). One solution is to use a web-based tool to share text with learners in real-time. Whenever you have a snippet of code they need, paste it into the web page so that they can copy and paste it on their machines.

I use Etherpad for this (e.g., <https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swc-tutorial>), and would be happy to create Etherpads at mozilla.org for any workshop that needs one. I'm not as satisfied with [GitHub Gists][1] (I've never liked machine-generated URLs) or Google Docs (update is slow), but your mileage may vary.
