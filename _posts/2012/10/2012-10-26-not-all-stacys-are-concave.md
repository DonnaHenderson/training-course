[This post][1] from Christopher Danie on teaching grade-school students about hexagons is brilliant. What&#8217;s an equivalent learning experience for programming? Can we show learners a dozen simple programs and ask &#8216;em to classify them into groups or a hierarchy?  Or identify common patterns?  It&#8217;s a powerful teaching exercise in other contexts&#8230;
