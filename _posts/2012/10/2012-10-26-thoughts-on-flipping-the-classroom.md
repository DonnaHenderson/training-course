Given how mature and motivated our learners are, should we stop lecturing and flip our classroom instead? I.e., ask them to watch videos *before* coming into our sessions, then focus our time with them on clearing up misconceptions and cementing concepts? On the one hand, it&#8217;s fashionable, and there is some research to back it up; on the other hand, creating watchable videos is labor intensive, [maintaining them is even worse][1], and since none of us have been through flipped classrooms outselves, we&#8217;d have to learn and practice more in order to apply the model well. If anyone wants to try the experiment and report back, please raise your hand <img src="http://localhost:8080/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />
