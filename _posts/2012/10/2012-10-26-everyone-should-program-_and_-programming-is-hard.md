[Good post][1] from Mark Chu-Carroll that says, "Yes, everyone should learn to program, but yes, it really is hard." It isn't as compelling to read as Bret Victor's demos are to watch (see points 1 and 2 in [this post][2]), but it resonates with what I've see in workshops.

> To write complicated programs is complicated. To write programs that manipulate symbolic data, you need to understand how the data symbolizes things. To write a computer that manipulates numbers, you need to understand how the numbers work, and how the computer represents them. To build a machine, you need to understand the machine that you're building. It's that simple.

Thoughts?
