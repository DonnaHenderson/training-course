## What I Learned :

I learned to make a concept map. That was a really awesome tool for thought organization, if a little tedious to graphically create. I am thoroughly convinced now of the need to sketch out a similar map any time I have something new to teach. The usefulness of this tool makes me wish I knew more about pedagogy in general and I can totally imagine that I would be a waaay better teacher if I learned more tools like that.

## What Could be Better :

On that note, I&#8217;ll be completely and totally honest. I didn&#8217;t buy the book (http://www.amazon.com/How-Learning-Works-Research-Based-Jossey-Bass/dp/0470484101/). Not even the kindle version ($22?!?! I&#8217;m in grad school, people&#8230;) . I found parts of it online, but not all of it. The parts I didn&#8217;t find, I didn&#8217;t read. I have to buy plenty of textbooks already and this one just wasn&#8217;t a priority. Is there a free version of the content you teach out of this book? Yes, I realize I&#8217;m a big ol&#8217; cheapskate. If I ever actually get a teaching job, I will buy this book. Pinky swear.

In other radical honesty, I also didn&#8217;t really read many other people&#8217;s blog posts. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m not interested in you guys. I&#8217;m interested. I just never added it to my rss reader. That would have added it to my morning routine and would have done the trick. Looking back, had someone suggested that reading everyone else&#8217;s blog posts would be essential/useful/helpful, I would have probably thought to add this to my rss reader before today. Just for kicks, I&#8217;m adding it now, but you might suggest that future Study Group students add the blog to their morning blog compendium (you know, if I&#8217;m not the only one who drinks from the internet firehose before coffee.)

## Seriously Though :

Thanks Greg ! !
