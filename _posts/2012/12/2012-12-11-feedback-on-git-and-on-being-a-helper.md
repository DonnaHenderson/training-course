1.  Several of you sent feedback on teaching Git, which is a useful complement to recent feedback from [Erik Bray][1] and [Fernando Perez][2].
2.  David Jones has written a good summary of [his experiences as a helper][3] at the boot camp in Edinburgh.

*Later: Azalee Bostroem and Mike Jackson have posted [feedback on the Edinburgh boot camp][4] as well.*
