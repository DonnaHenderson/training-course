Mark Guzdial&#8217;s [latest post ][1]is a good way to wrap up the year: his comments on making instruction fit local culture are as applicable to scientists as anyone else, and it&#8217;s great to see the data behind peer instruction, worked examples, and labeled subgoals. Of course, it all means more work for us&#8230;
