Here is a brief summary of the October 2012 UBC workshop, based on instructor comments and some comments from participants. Please add details in comments as appropriate.

The workshop was two days:  
Day 1 by Greg, in a large room with 70+ participants.  
Day 2 was split into a &#8220;Python version&#8221; (2 instructors including Greg), and an &#8220;R version&#8221; (4 instructors), each taking about half the participants from Day 1.

Comments from Python version instructors:  
&#8211; Had more plans for activities than were actually used due to too many topics.  
&#8211; Too much lecture.  
&#8211; Numerical methods in Python (as in what libraries are available, not implementation of formulas) seemed not useful for the audience.

&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;

Comments from R version instructors:  
&#8211; Too much content.  
&#8211; Skill level too low for many participants.  
&#8211; Too many instructors (leading to too many switches between people and topics, and general incoherence of the day).  
&#8211; Laura&#8217;s survey, about 12/35 responding: range of concerns about the workshop being &#8220;too fast&#8221; versus &#8220;enough content&#8221;  
&#8211; No noticable platform issues due to wodespread use of RStudio.  
&#8211; Concern about connection between Days 1 and 2.  
&#8211; Had more plans for activities than were actually used due to too many topics.  
&#8211; Easier distribution of sample code needed (perhaps using version control?)  
&#8211; From participant who was at the summary meeting: would be nice to have code to take away from the workshop. GW&#8217;s response is that heterogeneity of the disciplines an issue. Perhaps smaller, focused groups with disciplines could have this happen at their workshop.

&#8211; Notes from the end-of-workshop &#8220;Tell us one good/bad thing&#8221;, done verbally in last few minutes of the R version:

Bad  
too many functions in AM session today  
too fast (I think she said R day)  
no graphics  
match level better to participants (too slow some parts, too fast others)  
divide into advanced/beginner sections  
divide into advanced/beginner sections  
four people in one day: too many instructional styles (fast switching)  
shell session very basic (esp for people who have signed up as intermediate  
R users)  
add R stuff to website  
needs more R functions  
copy/paste too much on Day 2; maybe provide a file for reuse  
github did not quite work  
provide pre-reading/prep work to be ready  
so many new programs: cygwin, github, Rstudio  
Provide data sets earlier as well (beforehand)  
Two days did not fit together

Good  
think more about organizing data  
useful info  
learned about basic R functions  
new/fun stuff  
useful for organizing  
helpers very helpful!  
version control helpful  
so many new things (version control, R stuff Day 2)  
breadth of topics (new to me)  
software introduced is relevant  
typing in activities, start from blank on Day 1  
github live feedback good idea
