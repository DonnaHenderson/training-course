Here is a brief summary of the October 2012 UBC workshop, based on instructor comments and some comments from participants. Please add details in comments as appropriate.

The workshop was two days:  
Day 1 by Greg, in a large room with 70+ participants.  
Day 2 was split into a "Python version" (2 instructors including Greg), and an "R version" (4 instructors), each taking about half the participants from Day 1.

Comments from Python version instructors:  
--- Had more plans for activities than were actually used due to too many topics.  
--- Too much lecture.  
--- Numerical methods in Python (as in what libraries are available, not implementation of formulas) seemed not useful for the audience.

------------------------------

Comments from R version instructors:  
--- Too much content.  
--- Skill level too low for many participants.  
--- Too many instructors (leading to too many switches between people and topics, and general incoherence of the day).  
--- Laura's survey, about 12/35 responding: range of concerns about the workshop being "too fast" versus "enough content"  
--- No noticable platform issues due to wodespread use of RStudio.  
--- Concern about connection between Days 1 and 2.  
--- Had more plans for activities than were actually used due to too many topics.  
--- Easier distribution of sample code needed (perhaps using version control?)  
--- From participant who was at the summary meeting: would be nice to have code to take away from the workshop. GW's response is that heterogeneity of the disciplines an issue. Perhaps smaller, focused groups with disciplines could have this happen at their workshop.

---------------------------

--- Notes from the end-of-workshop "Tell us one good/bad thing", done verbally in last few minutes of the R version:

Bad  
too many functions in AM session today  
too fast (I think she said R day)  
no graphics  
match level better to participants (too slow some parts, too fast others)  
divide into advanced/beginner sections  
divide into advanced/beginner sections  
four people in one day: too many instructional styles (fast switching)  
shell session very basic (esp for people who have signed up as intermediate  
R users)  
add R stuff to website  
needs more R functions  
copy/paste too much on Day 2; maybe provide a file for reuse  
github did not quite work  
provide pre-reading/prep work to be ready  
so many new programs: cygwin, github, Rstudio  
Provide data sets earlier as well (beforehand)  
Two days did not fit together

Good  
think more about organizing data  
useful info  
learned about basic R functions  
new/fun stuff  
useful for organizing  
helpers very helpful!  
version control helpful  
so many new things (version control, R stuff Day 2)  
breadth of topics (new to me)  
software introduced is relevant  
typing in activities, start from blank on Day 1  
github live feedback good idea
