Feedback is critical in the learning process, and there is a whole chapter devoted to it in How Learning Works from the perspective of feedback to students. In the Conclusion (page 221) there is a more explicit (though brief) discussion about feedback to aid in improving instruction. In learning how to give a better workshop, feedback will also be critical, though you cannot rely on the participants to know what to provide (they are busy learning) and will have to take steps to collect useful information.

As you are planning your next workshop, something to consider is what you would like to know about what the participants are struggling with/have accomplished. You might use this information to:

*   rework something for the current workshop (announce after the coffee break, add onto next day&#8217;s lesson, etc.).
*   link to or post an additional resource if no time available and it does not affect very many participants.
*   rework the lesson for future workshops.

Suppose you have assigned a specific programming task during the workshop. Participants are asked to work on it and put up the appropriate coloured sticky to ask for help or to indicate completion. Is that enough information for you to conclude that the activity has &#8220;worked&#8221; or not? What else could you learn? Some example situations:

*   Tutors might learn that the people who need help are mostly not stuck on the current concepts but rather some OS- or install-related issue. How will you record and use this?
*   Though participants are not stuck, the activity is slower than you imagined and is eating into the coffee break. How will you record and use this information, and what else might you want to know in making a decision about the activity (now and later)?
*   If you are the current presenter, how do you know if the participants are following you? Are you able to check in with them adequately with the stickies? What can the tutors tell you about the state of the participants during a lesson? How might you record and use this?

I hope these kind of prompts are useful. Even if you are already collecting some information (the reflective summaries of workshops are a step in this direction), this type of thinking is needed whenever you want to change things, and usually there is more that could be done. Two final questions on this:

*   What happens if you don&#8217;t record this sort of information?
*   What happens if you are able to share what you&#8217;ve learned with other workshop instructors?
