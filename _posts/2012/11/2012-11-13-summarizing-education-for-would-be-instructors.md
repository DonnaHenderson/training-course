I've started putting together an [instructor's guide][1] for Software Carpentryâ€”something chapter-length that summarizes key points from educational research and how they apply to what we're teaching. As part of the final exercise for each cohort, I'll be asking people what they've learned from this study group (or elsewhere) that *isn't* in there.
