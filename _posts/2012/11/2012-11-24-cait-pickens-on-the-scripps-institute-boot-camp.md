Cait Pickens (a grad student from Michigan State University) has written a great series of posts about the boot camp she helped teach at the Scripps Institute a couple of weeks ago:

1.  [Preparation][1]
2.  [Day 1, Part 1][2]
3.  [Day 1, Part 2][3]
4.  [Day 2, Part 1][4]
5.  [Day 2, Part 2][5]
6.  [Day 2, Part 3][6]

She also has a post describing how they used [HipChat in the classroom][7], which is *almost* what I think we need to do [peer instruction online][8]. There's lots of good stuff to think about hereâ€”recommended.
