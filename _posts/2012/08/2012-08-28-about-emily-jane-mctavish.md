Emily Jane is a PhD student in Ecology, Evolution and Behavior, at the University of Texas at Austin (looking to finish up in Spring 2013). She&#8217;s studying the global evolutionary history of cattle, with a focus on Texas Longhorns. She&#8217;s interested in developing computational tools for using genomic data to understand evolution and the tree of life. It&#8217;s an exciting time to be a biologist, new tools are generating vast amounts of DNA sequence data, and a lot of programming needs to happen to interpret it all!
