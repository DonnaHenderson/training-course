1. Which of the following functions is an antiderivative of the function f(x) = x ?  
a) x  
b) x^2  
c) 1  
d) 0.5 * x^2

2. What is the integral of the function: f(x) = 2cos(x) + 3sin(x) ( dx ) ?

My questions are about integrals, because I&#8217;m not sure if I could change the subject to different than I made my pitch about.  
Nevertheless, those questions can be asked to high school students after the introduction to integrals.
