I&#8217;m a computer science PhD student at the University of Toronto in computational biology. I have a background in engineering, consider myself a data scientist, and care about design and the user experience. For research, I primarily work with bash, Python, and R to analyze and visualize human genetic and epigenetic data, but also work on a Java software tool used by clinical geneticists. I&#8217;ve been sporadically involved in Software Carpentry over the past few years: developing some content for v4, TAing for one of the course offerings, andÂ volunteering for a few bootcamps.
