Here I&#8217;m teaching the beginning of a lesson I prepared on testing and debugging for Edinburgh. This is purely the traceback part. I plan on teaching another smaller section on assertions and then sending students to an exercise. The room was small and the lighting not ideal for seeing both the projector and me.
