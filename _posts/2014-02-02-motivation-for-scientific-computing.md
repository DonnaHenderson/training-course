A recent Master&#8217;s student of mine left the University last spring, having done a piece of research almost ready to be a publishable paper. The work was about 80% done, and I took it over in the fall, starting with a large collection of data files, some Python scripts, and a mostly-completed manuscript.

It took me a month just to figure out the Python scripts. They defined new functions with names like &#8220;input&#8221; and &#8220;read&#8221; (often the same function name was used for different functions located in different .py files), and had almost no comments. They relied on being run from specific locations within a directory structure, which appeared to have changed several times. It took me another month to figure out the data files &#8212; where were the raw files, which ones had been used to make which processed data?

The student who had caused me such agony is a competent coder and an excellent writer. But how much more could our research group have accomplished if I hadn&#8217;t had to spend so much time just catching up on what he had already done? How much better would the student&#8217;s CV have looked if it had an *actual* published paper on it, rather than a 95%-done one?
