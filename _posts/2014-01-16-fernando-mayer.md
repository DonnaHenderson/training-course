I&#8217;m [Fernando Mayer][1], an oceanographer, currently an assistant professor of statistics at [Federal University of Rio Grande (FURG)][2], and doing a PhD in statistics at [Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ)][3] from [University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP)][4], Brazil. I have learned programming in FORTRAN, but now I use R and shell scripts extensively. My research interests are in statistical models applied to environmental problems, and programming is an essential part of this.
