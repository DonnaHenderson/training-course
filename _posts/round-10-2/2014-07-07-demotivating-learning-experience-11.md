One of my most demotivational learning experiences happened during my academic studies. While working on a year-long project, my supervisor at the time unfortunately had a significant impact on my motivation to complete the project and even my ongoing interest in the topic. Perhaps it was because I was early in my academic studies and the professor preferred to focus their attention on graduate research (not an excuse in my opinion), but our meetings were short / didn&#8217;t leave room for discussion, and the environment was one in which I didn&#8217;t feel comfortable asking questions or seeking clarification. I sent my drafts, the prof made written comments, I went to the office to pick them up at which point he a short commentary on the comments, then I left to continue writing. This experience had a negative impact on my interest in taking on independent research projects and in working one-on-one with professors. Since this experience, I have thankfully had many positive learning opportunities to do independent research and have received valuable, positive support from professors.

To improve the problem described above, I think it would have been beneficial for the professor to get to know my interests as a student &#8211; why was I undertaking the course, what was I learning throughout the process, what were my goals after graduation, how could additional support be given to facilitate learning (from my perspective), etc. Communication, or the lack thereof, had a bit impact in this situation. When I work with students now, I remember to ask questions, be engaged, and listen. Understanding the individual and their experiences with the project / question can go a long way in helping provide effective support and guidance.
