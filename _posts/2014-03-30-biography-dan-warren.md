I work at the interface of evolution, ecology, and conservation biology.  I am particularly interested in how species&#8217; ecological tolerances determine their geographic ranges, and how we may use distributional data to infer ecological and evolutionary processes.  I am currently starting a DECRA fellowship at Macquarie University in Sydney, where I will focus on the development of methods for incorporating evolutionary history into this process.
