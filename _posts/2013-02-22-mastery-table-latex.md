I am not really an expert in any of the SWC topics (except maybe subversion&#8230; maybe not) so I chose LaTeX. Hopefully someone else knows enough about LaTeX to comment. Here&#8217;s my table:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      What Does a Novice Know?
    </th>
    
    <th>
      What Does a Competent Person Know After a Workshop?
    </th>
    
    <th>
      What Does an Expert Know?
    </th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr valign="top">
    <!--Novice--></p> 
    
    <td>
      -You can use Word to make things look nice.<br /> -You can also use PowerPoint or Excel.<br /> -HTML also lets you specify how things look but it&#8217;s not reliable for things that you&#8217;re going to print out
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <!-- Competent -->
      
      <br /> -The concept of compiling one kind of file into something completely different.<br /> -The difference between text files and other kinds of files.<br /> -How to edit text files and what tools will break them.<br /> -What a LaTeX document looks like and how it is compiled into a finished document.<br /> -How to create (or borrow) a LaTeX file.<br /> -How to build a document using LaTeX source files and the<br /> appropriate command line commands.<br /> -About LaTeX document classes (they exist, there are a few common ones).<br /> -About LaTeX styles and how to install them.<br /> -How to modify an existing file<br /> -How and where to find help<br /> -What you can create in LaTeX: articles, books, essays
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <!-- Expert --></p> 
      
      <p>
        -Principles of typography and how to use LaTeX to apply them (i.e.,<br /> kerning, font choice)<br /> -How TeX works: glue, boxes<br /> -How to use LaTeX for images, tables, lists, headers and footers, and other document elements<br /> -How to redefine environments and commands<br /> -How to create your own styles<br /> -Using Makefiles and version control to manage the editing and<br /> building process.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>
          It&#8217;s a little ironic that a post about LaTeX should be so horribly formatted, but I don&#8217;t have time to sweet-talk WordPress&#8217;s table style, so I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll have to manage and you&#8217;ll have to take my word for it that I understand the principles of typography. <img src="http://localhost:8080/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
