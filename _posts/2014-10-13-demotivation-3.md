My most memorable demotivation happened quite recently.

**The Story:** I was enrolled in a physics Ph.D. program part-time at a local public university. I was quite the unusual student for that program as I was working full time in addition to taking courses. My first professor at this university was great, very understanding if I had to skip class for a conference or whatever. He was great. At the end of my first semester I was extremely motivated. The first professor made me feel like I could move mountains. My second professor however, was a different story.

He was teaching a pretty difficult course and I was struggling along with the rest of the students &#8211; Jackson E&M if you&#8217;re wondering. I was getting decent marks in the course and felt like I had a good handle on the material. So far, not so bad. I went to the professor after class one day to let him know that I needed to miss a day of class the next week due to a mandatory meeting at work. He kind of gave me a funny look then asked me about where I work, what I do, etc etc. He apparently had no idea I wasn&#8217;t a regular graduate student. Fast forward to the next quiz (the following week), I get my score back and it&#8217;s significantly lower than before. I went to talk to him about it after class since my answers were nearly identical to another student&#8217;s whose score was more of what I expected &#8211; I really thought I had missed something major to get a score as low as I did. Instead of pointing out an error in my answer, he proceeded to give me a lecture about how I was wasting my time at my job and those are the scores he expects someone in my situation to be getting. He dropped the line, &#8220;school is more important than your job&#8221;. I realized right then and there would be no fair grade for me in this course. My job was the reason I was going back to school in the first place.

I try for the rest of the semester, but my heart isn&#8217;t in it. I knew no matter what work I presented him, I wouldn&#8217;t get the score I deserved. Before the end of the semester I decided to quit the program. I realized that I couldn&#8217;t handle 5 more years of those games  (that professor taught a lot of courses and graded the EM quals).

**What could have been done:** I could have called the professor out on his biased grading.  Or went and talked to the graduate advisor. Heck, I could have gone to the university&#8217;s HR. Although, the professor had tenure, so it&#8217;s unlikely anything would have happened.

In the end, I found a better graduate program at a more prestigious university and was accepted before the end of that semester. My current program is much more accepting of part-time students and is filled with people like me &#8211; working individuals in science. A much better environment than before!
