Hi all,

my name is Marcello, I am an experimental particle physicist. I have spent 14 years working at the ATLAS experiment at CERN, so I can claim to have contributed to ~1/6000th of Englert and Higgs&#8217; Nobel Prize in Physics!

I have always been more interested to the R&D and computing aspects of large collider experiments, so now that the LHC experiments are fully built and running, I am looking for a new challenge. By taking a sabbatical in Canada, and I am hoping to explore new opportunities, such as teaching or divulgation.
