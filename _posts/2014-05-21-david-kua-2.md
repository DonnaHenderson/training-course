Hey there,

I&#8217;m an undergraduate student Computer Science at the University of Toronto. I work professionally as a developer using mainly Python and Go. I have an interest in doing programming for the sciences and research. I am taking this course because I want to be able to be able to share the programming knowledge that I have. Cheers!
