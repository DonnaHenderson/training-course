1. Which of the following will raise an exception?

a. my_list = [x*2 for x in (1,2,3,4)]  
b. my_list = [x*2 for x in (&#8216;a&#8217;,&#8217;b&#8217;,&#8217;c&#8217;,&#8217;d&#8217;)]  
c. my_list = [x*2 for x in 1234]  
d. my_list = [x*2 for x in &#8216;abcd&#8217;]

2. What is the difference between list comprehension and a generator?

a. A generator does not guarantee the ordering of items.  
b. List comprehension is faster when using built-in functions.  
c. List comprehension does not require holding iterated objects in memory.  
d. A generator does not allow list methods like slicing.

(Notably, #2 is not strictly a &#8220;why&#8221; question, but I think it still gets at teasing out usage reasoning rather than straightforward usage facts&#8230;)
