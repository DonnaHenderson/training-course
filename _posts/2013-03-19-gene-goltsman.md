Hi all,  
I&#8217;m a bioinformatics data analyst / software engineer at the DOE Joint Genome Institute in Walnut Creek, California. My expertise areas are de-novo assembly of DNA sequence and other primary high-throughput sequence data analyses. This is almost by definition a polygamous marriage of several disciplines, so, like many in this field, I had to pick up my computer science skills ad hoc, and I&#8217;d like to help others avoid the pitfalls I&#8217;ve fallen into.
