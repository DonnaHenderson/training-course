Hi!  I'm on the Community Building team at Mozilla and finished my MLS at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I work as a reference librarian for North Carolina's virtual reference service as well.  I have a little experience programming through classes and independent work, but I am excited to learn more.  Here is my website: http://www.jennierosehalperin.me
