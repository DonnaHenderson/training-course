I&#8217;m a quantitative population and community ecologist  and postdoc in the Department of Entomology at Michigan State University. I&#8217;m interested in how populations of economically and culturally important insects respond to changes in their environment. I work with two major long term projects- the Kellogg Biological Station Long Term Ecological Research site&#8217;s Main Cropping System Experiment, and the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center&#8217;s biodiversity group. I have a strong interest in managing long term, broad scale ecological data, and I blog about it at: <http://practicaldatamanagement.wordpress.com/>
