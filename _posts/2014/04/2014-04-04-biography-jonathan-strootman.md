I am a software engineer who is falling more in love with his craft every day! I am currently a developer on the core software team for a NSF funded life sciences cyber-infrastructure called *iPlant Collaborative*. With *iPlant*, I've done a great deal of work on the UI for our *Discovery Environment* platform.

Like many other software engineers, I am an unrepentant nerd. I play board games, video games (voyeuristically these days), and role-playing games. And thanks to [xkcd][1], I've made the strange connection between D&D stats .... and the gym!
