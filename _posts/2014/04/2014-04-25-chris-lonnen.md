I am the technical lead for Mozilla&#8217;s web engineering group, building tools to assist the engineering community. I&#8217;m also involved in mentoring and internship programs at Mozilla. In a past life I was a computational biologist at SUNY Geneseo where I helped pilot and continue to advocate for teaching scientific computing to undergraduates.
