Hi there! I am a PhD student in computer science and quantitative biology, working with Dr. Titus Brown. I am involved in the development of an efficient k-mer counting software package --- khmer and I am developing novel methods to evaluate the diversity of metagenomic sample and to compare the samples based on khmer.

I worked as a TA of an undergraduate course in my department for several semesters. That course is about using Python to teach the students without any programming experience how to program, which is sort of similar to the content of software carpentry workshop. I also helped teaching two Software Carpentry workshops previously. I hope I can learn more about the technique of teaching programming in this training.
