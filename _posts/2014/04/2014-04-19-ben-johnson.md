Hello everyone! My name is Ben Johnson and I am a PhD student at Michigan State University in the department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics. Currently, my project entails characterizing novel compounds, through both &#8220;wet&#8221; and &#8220;dry&#8221; techniques, identified from a high-throughput screen to find inhibitors of pH- and hypoxia-driven adaptation inÂ *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. Feel free to visit our laboratory [website][1] for more information if you&#8217;d like! Particularly, my interests lay in drug discovery, microbial pathogenesis, cheminformatics, and pharmacogenomics.

Initially, I was exposed to programming/bioinformatics through a course I was required to take for my bachelor&#8217;s degree. I hated it. That is, until I realized that the tools and techniques I was learning were applicable to a question I had in my own research. Thus, I am thoroughly looking forward to this workshop and learning how to better teach/learn/describe why computational biology is both applicable to life sciences research and a valuable skill in the arsenal of a biologist.
