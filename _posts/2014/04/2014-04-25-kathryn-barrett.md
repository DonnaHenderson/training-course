Hi all!

I'm Kathryn and I'm currently the Youth Program Lead at a not-for-profit called Ladies Learning Code. I spend my days planning fun tech-related workshops and camps for girls and boys between the ages of 6 to 17 under the youth titles Girls Learning Code (girl-only environment) and Kids Learning Code (girl and boy collaborative). I also develop and lead a lot of the workshop content myself, and have taught topics such as Game Design with Scratch and Electronics with Arduino. I sometimes also teach adults at Ladies Learning Code and have instructed HTML & CSS workshops and Data Visualization with Processing.

Looking forward to this course and meeting all of you!

Cheers,  
Kathryn
