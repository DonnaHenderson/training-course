I am a medical imaging researcher at Sunnybrook Hospital and former astrophysicist. Currently I work on MRI breast cancer screening to assess the probable malignancy of lesions. I grew up in Britain, have lived in Hungary, Spain and the US, now Toronto; and I have been using python to turn data into conclusions for ten years.
