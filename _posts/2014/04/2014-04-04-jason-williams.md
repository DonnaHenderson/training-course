My background is in molecular biology and I have been at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory for the past 10 years. I currently am a project lead for the Education, Outreach, and Training component of the *iPlant Collaborative, *an NSF-Funded cyberinfrastructure project for the life sciences. I primarily do training for their data and bioinformatics platforms. I am also recently participating as a member of TGAC&#8217;s (The Genome Analysis Center) scientific training advisory board. I am a Trekkie and also into most forms of classical music (Bach to Berg). I like long walks on the beach, and am sensitive to all things beautiful.
