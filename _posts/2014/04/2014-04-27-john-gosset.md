Hi! I'm a consultant and developer based in Montreal. I provide training for a variety of open-source technologies to organizations of various types and sizes. I'm very interested in how people learn and develop new technical skills, and the strengths and weaknesses of different pedagogical approaches in that context. Really looking forward the workshop and to meeting you all!
