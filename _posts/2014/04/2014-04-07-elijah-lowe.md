I'm Elijah Lowe. I attend Michigan State University, where I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science and Quantitative Biology. I enjoy teaching and training researchers. I have been a teaching assistant for my adviser's (Dr. Titus Brown) summer Next Generation sequencing course, and also trained summer researchers.
