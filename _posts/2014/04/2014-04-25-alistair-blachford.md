Hi! I am mostly a biologist (ecology and evolution). In undergrad I grabbed a lot of computer science for its use in biology. Since then all my jobs have been courtesy of the taint of computing. For decades now I&#8217;ve managed a small computing facility to support the research of graduate students and faculty. I occasionally teach short computing courses which the students seem to enjoy, but I&#8217;m underwhelmed by how much they learn. Looking for nuggets to use. Â Oh, and I&#8217;d rather be wilderness sea kayaking.
