I'm a marine microbial ecologist interested in using computational tools to investigate the functional diversity of marine bacteria. I'm currently a postdoc in the DeLong lab at MIT, where we are trying to understand which genes are involved in bacterial degradation of oceanic dissolved organic matter, one of the largest, but least understood, pools of organic carbon on the planet.
