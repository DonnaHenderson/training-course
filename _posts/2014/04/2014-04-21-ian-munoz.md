Hello there,

I am a scientific programmer at SESYNC. I provide support, assistance, and education to our postdoc researchers and working groups that pass through SESYNC. My background is in economics & math. I started programming in C/C++ while studying as an EE. I mostly program in R but I try to not be to shy about using any language or platform.
