Hi everybody! Looking forward to meeting you all in Toronto.

I&#8217;m a group leader at the Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC) in Norwich, UK, working on investigating interesting datasets from next-generation sequencing, particularly heterogeneous data, with a view to research software and algorithms for data integration, data management, interoperability, metadata, and metagenomics assembly.

We develop a lot of software in my group, and I&#8217;m a big advocate of everything Open Science and best practice &#8211; open source code, open data, open review! I&#8217;ve delivered a SWC bootcamp this year at TGAC and am eager to get into the instructor training.
