Hi there.  My name is Dana and I am a librarian at Concordia University College of Alberta in Edmonton.  I am sort of an accidental web librarian. I never meant to go this way, but I have slowly came to realize that my work as a librarian became much easier and more rewarding, as I learned more PHP and javascript. And I really believe this is the way librarianship is going, and programming skills are becoming increasingly valuable in the field, so I want to help my fellow librarians develop these skills as well.
