Hi everyone. I'm a system administrator with the iPlant Collaborative primarily dealing with the data store (iRODS) and Atmosphere (Open Stack and previouslyÂ Eucalyptus). I also have a background in software development in Java, Perl, Ruby and most recently Python. I'm a long time Linux user going back to the days of installing Slackware using 3 1/2&#8243; floppy disks. In addition to working with iPlant I'm also on the board of our local hackerspace and have partnered with the both the county library system and local schools to offer teaching electronics soldering, intro programming classes and robotics workshops to teens in Scratch, Python, Arduino and Lego Mindstorms. Most of my recent work related activities has been supporting Evolutionary Biology labs with their computing, specifically HPC support.
