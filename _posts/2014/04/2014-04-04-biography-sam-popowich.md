My name is Sam Popowich, and I'm the Discovery Systems Librarian at the University of Alberta. I've been involved with programming in libraries for around five years, and I'm interested in helping to promote and train librarians and library staff to code, to be more productive and have more control over the work they do. I'm also an organizer of the Edmonton chapter of Code4Lib.
