hi all. i'm a senior educator / remote sensing ecologist at NEON in Boulder. NEON will provide 30 years of free ecological data for use in research and education. We are interesting in facilitating the use of these data through workshops and online materials in both the classroom and informal free choice, learning. Looking forward to meeting all of you!
