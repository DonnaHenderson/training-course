Hi everyone. I'm a computational biophysicist and study how membrane proteins work using computer simulation, mainly molecular dynamics (MD). My background is in physics and I'm now in a biochemistry department. We don't tend to contribute much to the MD codes we use, such as NAMD or GROMACS, since they are very complex and mature. Instead our effort is focussed on writing good code to analyse the trajectories produced by the simulations so learn something important. In the last few years this has shifted into python, thanks to a community python module, MDAnalysis (http://bit.ly/1hfm7HS), that I've contributed a bit to. I organised the first Software Carpentry bootcamp in Oxford, back in October 2012 (see the posts on my blog:Â http://bit.ly/1fcHXvO), have helped on another and would like to start instructing. I'm also very interested in volunteer distributed computing --- like SETI@home or folding@home --- and am in the early stages of setting up my own project.
