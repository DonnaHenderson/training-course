Hello! I am a data analyst based in Montreal, QC. I did a PhD in theoretical/computational physics and a very short postdoc in biophysics at McGill University. I love the startup scene and the FLOSS community. I got involved with local user group Montréal-Python in 2013, from where I cofounded PyLadies Montréal and organized for a year. I have known and promoted Software Carpentry since January 2013. I speak and teach regularly at local events.
