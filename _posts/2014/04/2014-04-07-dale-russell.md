I just graduated from Wayne State University&#8217;s MLIS program fall 2013 and I am currently on the job hunt. Before beginning my MLIS I taught high school in Florida from 2004-2010 and I worked with English Language Learners, Remedial Reading students- I also have several years of teaching at the Community College level.Â  I recently participated in Start-up weekend Library Edition where to my surprise my pitch made into a team and we worked very hard but only reached mid-validation stage.
