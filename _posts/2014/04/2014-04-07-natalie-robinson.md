I recently finished a PhD at the University of Colorado, Boulder, where I studied the causes of species diversity patterns in urban, fragmented ecosystems around the globe. This work was part of my broader interest in the spatial ecology of speciesâ€™ interactions with their environments, and in using the computational tools that are now available to analyze the causes of ecological patterns in nature. I am currently a quantitative ecologist at the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), where I process and analyze continental-scale ecological data that will be used by scientists worldwide to better understand the responses of species and ecosystems to such disturbances as climate and land-use change.
