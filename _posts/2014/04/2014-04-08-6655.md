I am new Statistical Consultant at Cornell University (Ithaca, NY), where we help researchers from all fields with analysis. We teach workshops on various analysis topics and will host a bootcamp in June. My background is in quantitative ecology with a focus on community ecology (multivariate analysis) and landscape ecology (spatial analysis). I'm an academic alum of Univ. Rochester, Univ. Wisconsin-Madison and Iowa State Univ.
