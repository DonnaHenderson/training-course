So, grad school is a pretty demotivating experience all around! You work in isolation, on a difficult problem that may be impossible and that no one else really knows how to do. Projects fail quite often, which is quite depressing.

Since this description of grad school is taken as a given and inevitable, it&#8217;s hard to know how to change it. A system with more support for grad students would be nice (more frequent advising, etc) would be nice but probably not going to happen.
