Every instance in my educational history I could think of where I was demotivated had something to do with a class or task that I did not succeed or do well in.  In some cases I received criticism from the instructor while in others the instructor was not a participant in my working through my failing at a task (in the latter cases, sometimes I wished they had helped me somehow).  When the instructor did provide criticism, it was always justified and accurate (i.e., I really did mess up).

One story:  in elementary school, I was taking a pottery class and when I went to create a glaze pattern on the pot I had turned, I just dipped it from one bucket of glaze to another without waiting for the earlier coatings to dry.  The teacher scolded me for ruining the buckets of glaze.  I was mortified and for the rest of the course, the joy of making pottery evaporated and I decided to just get through the course.  The thing is, I knew at the time I hadn&#8217;t understood the teacher&#8217;s instructions and that I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing, but I was too embarrassed and shy to say anything and so just plowed forward.  And so, even though I felt really bad after the scolding, I knew I had deserved it.  In the many years subsequent, the memory of that experience prods me to ask for help if I don&#8217;t understand something, even if I feel embarrassed to ask (which happens a lot, to this day).  So, while I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve turned a pot since that class, I feel like something good came out of it.

When I think about what could have been done differently with regards to demotivation, part of me feels like my own sensitivity is a big player in it.  That is to say, being demotivated is partly due to my reception of failure rather than due to the instructor&#8217;s criticism or other factors.  In the pottery case, perhaps my teacher could have taken me aside in the class and walked me through what I had done wrong, worked with me on improving my listening to instructions, and encouraged me to ask when I didn&#8217;t understand (as well as encourage me what part of my pot did look right).  Certainly, this is what I try to do now with my own kids.  But, there were other students in the class, I did mess up a load of expensive glaze, and I don&#8217;t blame my teacher in any way.
