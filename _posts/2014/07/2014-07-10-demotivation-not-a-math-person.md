\## Not a math person

My demotivation surrounding maths cannot be tied to any one event. I slowly  
grew to despise math in high school, when the problems began to grow in  
abstractness but the purpose of these mathematical tools remained a mystery.  
My instructors were generally much more interested in ensuring I could repeat  
definitions exactly, use terms properly, and preforms well on their contrived  
tests. No matter how hard I tried, I didn&#8217;t do well on those tests: partially  
because I am not adept at encoding information without context, and later,  
because I was told by multiple math instructors that I am not a &#8216;math person&#8217;.

I don&#8217;t believe in math people. Surely there are some individuals who are  
better suited to test-taking (through either sheer discipline or a superior  
memory), and there are those special individuals who are able to generate new  
proofs, but on the average people are discouraged from pursuing general-  
purpose math who don&#8217;t perform well on these early abstract tests. I&#8217;ve been  
fortunate to have the opportunity to teach myself some of what I missed during  
graduate school: neuroscience gave me the context necessary to understand  
why linear algebra is important, and suddenly the principals came easily to me.  
I am playing many years of catch-up now, but realize my original demotivations  
were driven by equal parts rigid teaching style and inappropriate labeling.
