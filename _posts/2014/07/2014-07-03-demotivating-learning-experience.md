Over the course of the last five or six years, I&#8217;ve tried to teach myself various programming languages (as a non-programmer) with limited success. There were numerous roadblocks that arose each time &#8211; from lack of resource and guidance to life just getting in the way. I wasn&#8217;t working towards anything, or framing these tasks in applying my incremental learning in any concrete way.

In one instance in particular, a friend set out to help me learn Ruby, wanting to make me his &#8220;test case&#8221; to teach and increase my proficiency. After sending a few online resources (which were fun, but never applied what I was learning to a real problem so I knew how they worked together, or help me think critically about a problem), he bought me &#8220;The Pragmatic Bookshelf&#8221; (also known as &#8220;the pickaxe&#8221;) and set me on my way, believing all problems would be solved from that point forward and his work was done.

What I learned from that was that pushing a book to a novice isn&#8217;t always the best fit solution towards training (and in my case, only further disincentivized me from pursuing learning). It cast the notion of gaining fluency in a language as an insurmountable challenge and only fueled my imposter syndrome, rather than encourage me to continue to work my way through exercises with in-person help and support. Clearer steps about how to link this knowledge would have definitely helped, as well as less implied &#8220;well, if you can&#8217;t figure it out from this book, you can&#8217;t cut it&#8221;. Learning how to program (which is still an ongoing exercise for me) is overwhelming enough on its own.
