I&#8217;m a research programmer supporting neuroimaging labs and have experience writing and teaching MRI analysis using open tools, but my own research interests are emerging closer to computational ecology and the microbiology of food. I&#8217;m a contributor to the open experimental presentation software [psychopy][1], and just closed a three year old github feature request tagged [#dreams][2].
