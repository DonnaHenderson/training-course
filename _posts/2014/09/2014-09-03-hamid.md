I&#8217;m starting a postdoc at the University of Minnesota where I work on estimation and sensor fusion applications.  During my graduate research I used Python-based tools heavily for both design and experimentation. I enjoyed it and ended up teaching a class on the tool-set at our University.

I&#8217;m excited to learn more about software tools for scientists and engineers though this training.  Both for my own usage, and to share that knowledge with friends and colleagues.  I&#8217;ve benefited greatly from the instruction and experience of others and I hope to share some of that more effectively based on the training in this course.
