I&#8217;m an <a title="Experimental Officer" href="http://www.exeter.ac.uk/biomedicalhub/team/drjeremymetz/" target="_blank">Experimental Officer</a> for Image Analysis in Biosciences at Exeter University. In that capacity, I continuously develop image processing techniques to analyse and model the resulting biological insights to a wide range of Biological phenomena.

I work mainly with Python and a variety of Image Processing libraries (opencv, scipy.ndimage, scikit-image) but am also experienced in C++ , Matlab, and Java.

My teaching activities include Image Processing workshops in ImageJ and Python, as well as group and individual tutorials and training sessions.
