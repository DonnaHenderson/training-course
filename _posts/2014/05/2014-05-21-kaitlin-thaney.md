I&#8217;m the director of the [Mozilla Science Lab][1], an initiative of the [Mozilla Foundation][2] working to make the web work for science (and parent organization of [Software Carpentry][3]). Prior to Mozilla, I served as the Manager of External Partnerships at [Digital Science][4], a technology company founded out of [Macmillan Science and Education][5] focused on research tools and incubation for [science startups][6]. I&#8217;ve worked in &#8220;open science&#8221; since 2006, formerly managing the [science wing][7] of [Creative Commons][8], where we worked on the underlying [infrastructure][9] and policy for the [Open Access][10] and [Open Data][11] movement. I&#8217;m a strong advocate of knowledge sharing and the open web, and advise policymakers in both the US and the UK on digital infrastructure, data-intensive science and education to make scientific research more collaborative, open and reproducible. I also double as [Greg&#8217;s boss][12] (and really keen to be trained up as an instructor). You can find me online [@kaythaney][13].
