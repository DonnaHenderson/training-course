<span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19.5px;">Hi folks! I’m Catherine McGoveran (@kittmcg) – Government Information Librarian at the University of Ottawa. I’m big into the open (including library) data side of things and am interested in obtaining / improving skills to work with this data for visualization, analysis, map creation, and so on. I&#8217;m hoping this course will help me with the instructional design side of being a librarian – effectively teaching a variety of types of material (including software) to a variety of groups (students, profs, colleauges,&#8230;). </span></span>
