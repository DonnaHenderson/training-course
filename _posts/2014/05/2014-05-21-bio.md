Hi All! I am a retired Army Intelligence Officer with a passion for foreign languages, mathematics and scientific computing. I currently work part time as a Computer Operator at Carnegie Mellon University&#8217;s School of Computer Science, supporting the efforts of our Grad and PhD students. After attending a Software Carpentry Bootcamp last summer, I decided that I wanted to be a part of this organization by hosting and instructing future bootcamps at CMU.

Cheers!!
