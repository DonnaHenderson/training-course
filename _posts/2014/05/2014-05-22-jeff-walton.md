Howdy, I teach geospatial technology courses (remote sensing, photogrammetry, GPS surveying) at Paul Smith&#8217;s College in the Adirondack mountains of northern New York where I am also the dean of the school of natural resource management.  I was able to attend the SWC boot camp at PyCon in Montreal and would like to participate in other training events.  I have worked as a data analyst and researcher in the aerospace and natural resource fields, and have done programming in Fortran and C.  I have used bash for many years, R for remote sensing data analysis and classification, and Python for small tools and data management tasks.
