Hi all,

I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Melbourne studying <a title="Systems Biology" href="http://www.inouyelab.org/" target="_blank">Systems Biology</a> through the application of network methods to high-throughput human molecular data, primarily using R. Despite coming from a computer science background my learning experience with R has been frustrating due to a lack of teaching resources. After hearing about Software Carpentry and helping out at a local Python bootcamp, I decided I wanted to fill that void by becoming trained as an Instructor in R to share my knowledge with other researchers.
