Hi, I'm an undergraduate student pursuing BSc in Automatics Control and Robotics (very similar to Electrical Engineering) at [AGH University of Science and Technology][1] (Krak√≥w, Poland).

My main hobby, and actually a job, is programming. I love Python to death, I'm active in Polish Python community; I attended two recent PyCons US/NA (Santa Clara, CA and Montreal QC).

Greg Wilson is my mentor for a project "Peer Instruction" for [Summer of Code][2] --- more details [here][3].

Apart from that I'm also a chairman for [Student's Scientific Association in Computer Vision][4] at AGH. My main project is a "digitizer" or copy machine for 3D.

From time to time I want to teach my friends programming and "stuff", but I'm not a good instructor. Hopefully this will change after this course.
