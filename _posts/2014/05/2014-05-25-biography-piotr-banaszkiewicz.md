Hi, I&#8217;m an undergraduate student pursuing BSc in Automatics Control and Robotics (very similar to Electrical Engineering) at [AGH University of Science and Technology][1] (Krak√≥w, Poland).

My main hobby, and actually a job, is programming. I love Python to death, I&#8217;m active in Polish Python community; I attended two recent PyCons US/NA (Santa Clara, CA and Montreal QC).

Greg Wilson is my mentor for a project &#8220;Peer Instruction&#8221; for [Summer of Code][2] &#8211; more details [here][3].

Apart from that I&#8217;m also a chairman for [Student&#8217;s Scientific Association in Computer Vision][4] at AGH. My main project is a &#8220;digitizer&#8221; or copy machine for 3D.

From time to time I want to teach my friends programming and &#8220;stuff&#8221;, but I&#8217;m not a good instructor. Hopefully this will change after this course.
