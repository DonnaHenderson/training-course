I&#8217;m a PhD student working out of the Center for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate in Copenhagen (previous a grad student in Canada). I make use of R in all of my analyses, but I&#8217;ve been introduced into the python crowd by a software carpentry workshop and am now starting to use it quite a bit in my work. If anyone is in and around the Copenhagen area, feel free to send me a message- would love to chat over coffee and danishes!
