Hi everyone, I am a 2nd year Mathematics PhD student at the University of Warwick. A big part of my PhD project is developing a simulation software to study capillary blood flow using particle methods.

I admire well-written software and I am enthusiastic about learning the techniques that make it possible. I think that the production of good software in a research environment is not always encouraged, with good coding practices often being** **highly undervalued**.** I feel this is caused by lack of understanding and awareness.

I was a helper at a bootcamp last April. It was a great experience, and I decided to join the instructor training (Christina Koch, thanks for the nudge!) I am looking forward to meeting more Software Carpentry people, and learning how to help other scientists make good software.
