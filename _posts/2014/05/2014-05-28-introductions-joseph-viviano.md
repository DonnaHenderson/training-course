Hello everyone,

I'm an ex-neuroscientist / non-traditional neuroscientist (MRI, for those who are interested) who has become a little more interested in how science works than doing the science myself. I'm super excited to get involved in SC, learn from/with all of you, and eventually develop some useful workflow tools that will help the scientists productive (and sane). If you're in Toronto, I'll see you around!

Cheers,  
Joseph
