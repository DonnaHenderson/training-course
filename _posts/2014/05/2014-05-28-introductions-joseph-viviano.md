Hello everyone,

I&#8217;m an ex-neuroscientist / non-traditional neuroscientist (MRI, for those who are interested) who has become a little more interested in how science works than doing the science myself. I&#8217;m super excited to get involved in SC, learn from/with all of you, and eventually develop some useful workflow tools that will help the scientists productive (and sane). If you&#8217;re in Toronto, I&#8217;ll see you around!

Cheers,  
Joseph
