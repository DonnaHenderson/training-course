<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Hello,</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">I made a career change and became a biomechanical engineer last year. I work as a research fellow at the University of Leeds developing computational models of the artificial hip – I use the software packages Adams and MatLab. I run monthly meetings for the computational modellers in my department and would like to improve the computing skills of the group.</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Previously I was a computational scientist for over 10 years. For much of that time I worked on the boarders of academic research and supercomputer services. I specialised primarily in visualization and secondly in supercomputing. I did an MSC and PhD in visualization during this time. Before that I did a degree in Biophysics. </span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">I like computing, technology and biology/medicine. I am also interested in using art to find new ways to communicate science and DIY Biology.</span>
