Hi! --- I'm a high school science teacher in Seattle, a physicist by training with a background in computational biophysics.  I've been a user of Software Carpentry materials since early in my PhD work and am interested in contributing more to development of open science tools and to professional development for science teachers more generally.  I also currently teach a class for 9th graders that I call "How to think like a scientist", within which I hope to include computational thinking in the next iteration.

This is my third try at the teaching course --- life keeps getting in my way, so I hope to make it this summer between child care and other work.  I'd be very interested in meeting up with anyone in the Seattle area.
