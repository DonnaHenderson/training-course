IÂ am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Manel Esteller&#8217;s group at IDIBELL in Barcelona (Spain). I have a background in Mathematics and research experience both in academy and industry. In my work I do a lot of coding, mostly in Python and R. I appreciate well written, well documented and easy to mantain code. As a supporter of reproducible research, I believe that good coding skills should be in the toolbox of every scientist nowadays.
