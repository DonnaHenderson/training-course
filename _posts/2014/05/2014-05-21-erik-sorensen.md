I'm a professor of economics at Norwegian School of Economics, member of "[The Choice Lab][1]." I consider myself an applied econometrician, which means that I write code for statistical analysis; I've worked on issues in labour economics, international income comparisons, and on what people consider to be fair distributions of income in situations where they have made different contributions and might have different talents. For the research on fairness I also code interactive web-pages to implement experiments, in which participants are matched up and interact with each other in controlled environments.
