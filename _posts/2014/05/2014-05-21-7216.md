Hi everyone! I'm a hybrid biologist and software engineer, working at UBC in Vancouver, BC. I couldn't decide which direction to go in undergrad at UC Berkeley, so I did both: BS in Plant Genetics, BA in Computer Science. I then went the tech route and worked at Apple as a software engineer for four years. I got tired of coding for The Man (and I missed plants and science), so I went to get a PhD in Botany, specifically in plant phylogenetics. I am now in my second postdoc, and as my research progresses, I find that my background as a software engineer is more and more useful to me as a biologist. I haven't been in the lab in my entire time at UBC. In addition, because I basically disavowed the coding side for my entire PhD, I am very familiar with how much or little many biologists know about computers, software, and code, and I would love to try to help them bridge the gap between the two.
