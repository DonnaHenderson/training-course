Hi everyone, I'm an assistant professor in the Wildlife department at Humboldt State University. I'm primarily interested in the limits to species distributions, and I've got current projects working with giant kangaroo rats, white-footed voles, and porcupines. Students (both undergraduate and graduate) in our department are dying to get additional experience working with R, Python, and data management. While I've been programming for over 20 years, and teaching for almost 7, I don't have a lot of experience teaching others how to program. I've heard great things about Software Carpentry boot camps, and I look forward to learning this pedagogical approach.
