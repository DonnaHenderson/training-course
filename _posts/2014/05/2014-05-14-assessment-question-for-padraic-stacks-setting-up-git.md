(Questions for beginners to git and version control but with some CLI experience)

1. How would you setup your existing project to be under version control?

a)Â git clone ProjectFolder NewProjectFolder; (cd NewProjectFolder); git commit -m "First commit"

b) git init NewProjectFolder; (copy files from ProjectFolder to NewProjectFolder); git add *; git commit -m "First commit"

c) (cd to the top folder of project); git init; git add *; git commit -m "First commit"

d) git init ProjectName; (cd ProjectFolder); git add * ProjectName; (cd somewhere else); git checkout ProjectName NewProjectFolder

2. Explain how you can edit a file under version control and track the changes without having to change the filename constantly.
