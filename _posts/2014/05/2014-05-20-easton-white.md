Hi everyone! I&#8217;m currently a Fulbright student at the University of Victoria. I&#8217;ll be starting my PhD in Population Biology at UC Davis in the Fall. Most of my research involves using statistics or mathematics to answer biological questions (mostly focused on population ecology). I am also passionate about education, especially when it comes to helping scientists develop quantitative skills. I&#8217;m really looking forward to this instructor training course. See you all (virtually) in a few weeks.
