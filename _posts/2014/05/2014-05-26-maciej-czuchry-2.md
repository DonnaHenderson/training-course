Hi!

my name is Maciej and I&#8217;m a graduate in [Applied Computer Science][1] at [AGH University of Science and Technology][2] in Kraków, Poland.

My hobby is Computer Science, technologies and also computer games <img src="http://localhost:8080/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />

In my actual job I am software administrator in [Academic Computer Centre Cyfronet AGH][3] in Software Departament. I also prepare and lead some trainings for our (as Computer Centre) users, mostly scientists.

I hope this course will make me great teacher to make people learn easily.
