Hi there!  Starting mid-August, I'll be a Senior Lecturer and Director of Undergraduate Computing Education in the Computing and Software Systems Division of the University of Washington Bothell and an Affiliate Professor of Physics and Engineering at North Park University in Chicago.  I chair the American Meteorological Society's Python Symposium and am the author of the textbook *A Hands-On Introduction to Using Python in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences.*

My B.S. is in Mechanical Engineering and my M.S. is in Civil Engineering-Water Resources, both from Stanford University, and my Ph.D. is in Atmospheric Sciences from UCLA.  My interests include stochastic convective parameterizations for climate models, ice-atmosphere interactions in the Arctic, simple software frameworks for modularizing climate models, teaching programming to non-CS majors, and environmental ethics.
