Hi everyone

I&#8217;m a PhD student at the University of Victoria, BC and study the food web structure of coral reef fish communities: mainly, exploring how exploitation alters these systems and trying to understand the structure and function of pristine ecosystems. I use large datasets spanning the Pacific Ocean and so work a lot in R and on remote servers. A Software Carpentry workshop in April at a workshop at UVic convinced me that ecologists should all try to develop their computing skills, andÂ I&#8217;d like to establish a strong computing core of the lab I work in (baumlab.weebly.com). I&#8217;m hoping to use Software Carpentry training to do this &#8211; looking forward to getting going!
