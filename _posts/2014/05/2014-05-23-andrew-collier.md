Hi, I am Andrew Collier. I currently work as a Game Mathematician for a software and game development company in Durban, South Africa. In a previous incarnation I was a Space Physicist involved in research and supervising postgraduate students. I am interested in programming as a tool for data analysis and simulation. I have spent most of my time in recent years working in R, although I have experience in Python, C/C++ and FORTRAN. I have never done any formal Computer Science courses and everything that I know about computers has picked up along the line. In my current role I need to pass on some of my programming experience to my colleagues and I am hoping to learn efficient and effective ways to do that!
