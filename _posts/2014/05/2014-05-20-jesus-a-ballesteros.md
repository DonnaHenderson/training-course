Howdy, I am a Ph  D student at The George Washington University in D.C. My research focuses on using phylogenetics (and other bioinformatic tools) to understand spider&#8217;s diversity and evolution.

As many other grad students in the biological sciences, I have learn my bioinformatics on my own. Sometimes I can&#8217;t help regretting I was never taught all these skills the &#8220;right way&#8221;, specially when they seem so obviously useful. Thus I look forward being able to better transmit my experiences to my colleagues and students and keep learning in the process.
