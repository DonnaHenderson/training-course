Howdy, I am a Ph  D student at The George Washington University in D.C. My research focuses on using phylogenetics (and other bioinformatic tools) to understand spider's diversity and evolution.

As many other grad students in the biological sciences, I have learn my bioinformatics on my own. Sometimes I can't help regretting I was never taught all these skills the "right way", specially when they seem so obviously useful. Thus I look forward being able to better transmit my experiences to my colleagues and students and keep learning in the process.
