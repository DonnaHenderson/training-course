Hi, I am currently a postdoctoral biomechanics researcher in Cleveland, Ohio, USA where I&#8217;m working on the identification of human control during gait. I received my PhD from the University of California at Davis in a Sports Biomechanics lab and studied human control in the bicycle balancing task for my graduate work. My expertise lie in multibody dynamics, control systems, and system identification. I use computation for both simulation and data analysis and use a variety of computer languages to do so, with Python being my favorite to spend time in. In my spare time, I work with bicycle and pedestrian advocacy groups and teach DIY bicycle repair.
