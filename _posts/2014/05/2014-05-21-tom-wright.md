Hi,

I'm currently a research associate working in the field of ophthalmology at SickKids hospital in Toronto. My original BSc was in Biology from the University of Birmingham, however after that I started working as a systems engineer for a variety of companies around the UK, it was here I first got exposed to 'professional computing'.

My current research centers around electrophysiology (recording electrical potentials from the brain and retina) as well as high resolution imaging. My PhD is on signal analysis for visual electrophysiology and I am often developing custom applications for this and for image processing. Primarily I work in R or matlab although I dabble in a little python and other web technologies. Working in medical research has opened my eyes to the poor coding practiced even by large commercial companies. I find that even complex projects are often run by a single coder with little thought being given to source control, documentation etc. I know that with the pressure of making a working solution to a deadline I am often guilty of the same oversights.

I am excited about the potential for both improving my own skills and for evangelizing the benefits of good coding practice which I expect to aid collaboration and speed research.

I have two kids and enjoy cycling, canoeing, camping and almost everything else where I can't sit in front of a computer.
