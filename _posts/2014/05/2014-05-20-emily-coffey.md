I&#8217;m a PhD student in Neuroscience at McGill University.Â  I use musicianship as a model and a variety of neuroimaging techniques (EEG, MEG, fMRI, sMRI, etc.) to study questions like how the brain change when we practice a skill or what predisposes a person to learn a particular new skill quickly or not.

Like many people in our field with a background in psychology or neuroscience, I had never programmed anything before I got into research and had a pretty complicated problem to fight with. While I&#8217;m not really all that good/efficient/proper yet, I appreciate the flexibility and independence that programming and computer skills gives a researcher. In my opinion programming skills are so essential in our field that I would like to help promote them!

I&#8217;ve been a flight instructor and an astronaut instructor and do a lot of science outreach stuff, so I&#8217;ve been interested in teaching and training for a long time. I look forward to continuing to improve my teaching skills and learning to teach this particular skill!
