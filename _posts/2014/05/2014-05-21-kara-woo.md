Hi everyone, I&#8217;m an information manager at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (but I&#8217;m located at Washington State University). I currently work with a group of scientists studying plankton in Lake Baikal; my role is to help my colleagues organize and manage their data and eventually make it public. I&#8217;m looking forward to helping them and anyone else work more efficiently and reproducibly.
