Hi everyone, I'm an information manager at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (but I'm located at Washington State University). I currently work with a group of scientists studying plankton in Lake Baikal; my role is to help my colleagues organize and manage their data and eventually make it public. I'm looking forward to helping them and anyone else work more efficiently and reproducibly.
