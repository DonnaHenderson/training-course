Back in 2012, I invited a bunch of people to contribute a chapter each to a book with the working title, &#8220;What Everyone in Tech Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Education (No Exceptions)&#8221;. Unlike [*Beautiful Code*][1], [*Making Software*][2], and [*The Architecture of Open Source Applications*][3], it never came together, but I still think it would be useful: a lot of people are wasting a lot of time and money because they&#8217;re [a bit confused about the difference between money, intelligence, and expertise][4] when it comes to education, and I think a 30,000 word overview of key ideas—something you could read on a flight from New York to Silicon Valley—would could prevent at least some of that.

Warren Code and I have therefore put together a list of topics that we think could be introduced in 1000 words each. We&#8217;d be grateful for comments: what&#8217;s missing that really needs to be there, and what&#8217;s there that doesn&#8217;t need to be?

1.  Dewey, Piaget, Vygotsky, Freire (or, key figures in 100 words each)
2.  distance ed overview
3.  MOOCs
4.  are public schools actually failing?
5.  classroom management basics
6.  cognitive limits to learning (seven plus or minus two, attention fatigue, sleep deprivation)
7.  cognitive load theory and faded examples
8.  how education research is done: qualitative studies, quantitative studies, and comparison studies
9.  computer-based homework/teaching systems
10. concept inventories
11. developing homework (and in-class tasks?) that build expertise.
12. differences between novice, competent practitioner, and expert understanding
13. direct instruction vs. problem-based learning and inquiry-based learning
14. expertise in three parts (see how people learn&#8217;s intro, for example): prior knowledge, knowledge frameworks, metacognition.
15. fixed vs. growth mindset
16. forms of assessment
17. interactive engagement overview across STEM
18. learning objectives/outcomes/goals: some of the language used, some of the uses of these
19. learning styles (debunking thereof)
20. motivation
21. nature of evidence in education research, historical view?
22. novice programmer research overview, incl pair programming.
23. open licensing for education, creative commons, open educational resources (OER)
24. peer instruction
25. problem-solving skills overview
26. reverse instructional design
27. setting expectations in the classroom/promoting effective study habits
28. stereotype threat
29. the scholarship of teaching and learning (vs. education research vs. scholarly teaching)
30. what does it mean to &#8220;understand computing&#8221;?
31. writing effective multiple choice questions
