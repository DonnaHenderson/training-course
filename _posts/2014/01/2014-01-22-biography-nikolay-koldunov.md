I am currently working as a post-doc in the Institute of Oceanography, University of Hamburg. My research is focused on the Arctic region, in particular on the sea ice and the Arctic Ocean circulation. I work a lot with ocean numerical models and use python mainly for data pre/post processing and visualization.

I like to share my programming experience and do this on my blog (<http://koldunov.net> (in Russian)), and in colaboration with other people at <http://earthpy.org/> (in English).
