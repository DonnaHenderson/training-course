I'm a bioinformatician with a background in physics & computing, working in the Life Sciences Computation Centre at the University of Melbourne. We work on a variety of projects in genomics, but my work has been mostly in cancer research.Â I use Python and a bit of R in my work analysing high-throughput genomics data. We also do a lot of workshops and training, plus support for biologists (or biologists-turned-bioinformatician) who are often new to the computing side of things.

I also teach a Masters-level subject, Algorithms for Functional Genomics, so I'm hoping this course will give me some new ideas about teaching that as well!
