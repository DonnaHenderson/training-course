Hi there! I work for the University of Alberta in their Department of Family Medicine doing research on chronic diseases. I started with this group about five years ago after finishing off my Computer Engineering MSc and it's been great to be able to bring my skills to an area of research that is really lacking access to computational expertise. Normally my job wouldn't exist in this area because it is considered 'infrastructure' and many grants don't allow for funds to be spent that way. Fortunately the Public Health Agency of Canada decided that this project may be worth funding the infrastructure of.Â With the research that we have been doing, hopefully more funding agencies are starting to see the benefits of supporting positions like mine.

As well, after going to PyCon in 2013, a friend and I decided to start up an Edmonton Python meetup group and have been running monthly meetups for over a year now. It's great to have so many different people in the community step up to give some really amazing presentations.
