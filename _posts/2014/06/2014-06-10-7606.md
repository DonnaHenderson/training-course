Hello,

Iâ€™m a student pursuing BSc in Computer Science at AGH University of Science and Technology ( Cracow, Poland ).

In my free time I like running, swimming ( I&#8217;m younger water lifeguard ) and reading books that help me to improve my coding skills. 

In high school I was helping my Math Professor to organize camps preparing students from a few schools in Poland for Polish Mathematical Olympiad and I also gave a few lectures there.

I hope that this course will teach me how to give better and more interesting lectures.
