I hold a PhD in Theoretical Physics (Nonlinear Dynamics)  for which I had to do much numerical simulation (first in Fortran; than in C). Later I worked some years in web and database  programming, digital library, electronic publishing --- all heavily using perl 5 ---  espc. for the physics community, but also as a freelancer.  
At that time I also had the opportunity to teach users of a specially designed web publishing tool at a university.

The last several years I was working on an  
operational computing and data delivery service, where big amounts of data from geostationary satellites are processed in order to calculate the solar irradiance e.g. in Europe for applications in the Renewables, e.g. forecast of PV power production.

Just now I'm searching for a new working environment , preferably in an informatics/computational  context.

My teaching experience comprises mostly face to face help for master and PhD students or PostDocs. But I'd like to get more professional and conscious about teaching programming, maybe at least partly to earn my living.
