Hi I work as a scientific programmer and sensor scientist for a metrology company (read we make large robotic microscopes to measure things) in up state New York. I have a varied scientific background; I started out in organic chemistry and then move on to do a PhD and post-docs in neuroelectrophysiology.  While doing neuroscience I realized that software engineering practices and tools  were mighty useful and that we scientists should make them our own. I now want to pass on the things I have learned along the way that I wish I had been taught at the start of my scientific career.
