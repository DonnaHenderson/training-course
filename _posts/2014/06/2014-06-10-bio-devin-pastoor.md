Hi all,

I'm a PhD student in the field of pharmacometrics --- I help companies make informed drug development decisions! I spend a lot of time with clinical trial design, data analysis, and developing regulatory strategy for drug approvals. Most of my work is in R, and I've also dabbled in python and am currently exploring Julia (for performance) and stan (for bayesian modeling). I love teaching, I've taught a couple R courses, and last year I attended a software carpentry workshop and decided I wanted to become an instructor!

On the personal end --- I just got married (wohoo!) and spend my (minimal) free time playing tennis, basketball, and training for triathlons. I also love learning, so I spend a lot of time reading books on topics outside of the scope of my formal studies.
