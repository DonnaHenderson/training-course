Hi all,

I&#8217;m a PhD student in the field of pharmacometrics &#8211; I help companies make informed drug development decisions! I spend a lot of time with clinical trial design, data analysis, and developing regulatory strategy for drug approvals. Most of my work is in R, and I&#8217;ve also dabbled in python and am currently exploring Julia (for performance) and stan (for bayesian modeling). I love teaching, I&#8217;ve taught a couple R courses, and last year I attended a software carpentry workshop and decided I wanted to become an instructor!

On the personal end &#8211; I just got married (wohoo!) and spend my (minimal) free time playing tennis, basketball, and training for triathlons. I also love learning, so I spend a lot of time reading books on topics outside of the scope of my formal studies.
