Ok, at last here is my video. I had some problems with sourcing a good screencasting tool in Fedora Linux, I am using &#8216;SimpleScreenRecorder&#8217;, but my main issue was with the content.

I spent a long time thinking about what would interest people, and what might appeal to a broad[ish] range of people who work in libraries. In the end I think I showed too many things and not enough of each one, not to mind I never explained what the command line was, what the cat command was, how I outputted grep into .txt with &#8216;>&#8217;.



[The sound is horrific so keep it low]

My most demotivating educational experience was in secondary school (high school) physics. I was quite good at maths so was reasonably confident that I would be decent at physics. Right at the start of my second year I had a run of classes where I couldn&#8217;t get the correct textbook answer to maths physics problems.

Back in class the teacher went through the problems but also got the wrong answer. He brushed it off, saying that the method was what was important. I found that really frustrating since my method seemed to be to be the same as his and yet we both got wrong answers. I switched subjects as a result.
