Greetings all, following an MSc in computing science at Imperial College, London, I&#8217;ve worked in software and systems engineering in the telecomms and defence industry sectors, gaining experience in system design & architecture, documentation, code & testing, team and engineering management, and latterly with a strong emphasis on quality process improvement whilst running the technical team delivering an urgent complex defence project. After a short break in 2011/12 to do an MSc in meteorology at Reading University, I now work in the Reading e-Science Centre Group in the role of deputy technical director which requires the application of engineering skills to the software work packages in research projects undertaken in the department, and where I&#8217;m able to combine industrial experience in mapping systems and in the software delivery process with meteorological subjects such as environmental data.
