Howdy! My name is Sarah Simpkin (@sarahsimpkin), and I&#8217;m a GIS and Geography librarian at the University of Ottawa. While my formal education is in those fields, a lot of the tech work I do on a daily basis is self-taught. I attended the Software Carpentry librarian bootcamp at Pycon this year and had a great time learning alongside my colleagues. This summer, I&#8217;m hoping to become a stronger instructor for both the students in my GIS workshops and for my fellow librarians. You may also find me co-moderating the [libcode][1] community for GLAM (gallery, library, archive, and museum) workers learning tech skills. Pleased to meet everyone!
