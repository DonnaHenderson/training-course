I just started this year working at the OU Libraries as their Research Data Specialist. Prior to this I worked as the IT Specialist for the School of Meteorology. I have a BS in Physics and a MS and PhD in Meteorology. My love of munging weather data and computers led me towards the IT profession and to academia in order to work with student meteorologists to improve their "IT" skills. Owing to the amount of observational data and model output associated with weather has led me to my current position with the library.

Having the ability to work with students, faculty and staff with regards to "best practices" has been rewarding (and sometimes frustrating) opportunity. We plan to use the SWC as part of the libraries education outreach to the university community and as personal development for the librarians within the library. I would love to hear from any other library folks who are also enrolled for this session.
