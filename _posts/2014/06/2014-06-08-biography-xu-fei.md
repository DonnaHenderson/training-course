Hi everyone, I completed a master&#8217;s degree in neuroscience at McGill University last year. More specifically it was on measuring neurodegeneration using MRI. I learned to use R when couldn&#8217;t find any free program good enough for data analysis. My first Python lesson was given by a friend when I had to validate my data using a script. I am still learning both on my own, and I feel that it has never been a better time in history for free online programming training.

Right now I am working at the UN as a consultant in the enterprise learning section, as well as preaching about R and Python for data analysis/visualization. I am very interested in how people learn everything, especially programming. I strongly believe that this generation of scientists (or general office workers) would benefit tremendously from good computational skills, which are unfortunately not taught in most academic disciplines. I&#8217;d like to know more people who have a similar interest in teaching programming and learn from everyone in the instructor training.
