I&#8217;m a first year CS PhD student at MSU&#8217;s <a href="http://ged.msu.edu/" target="_blank">Laboratory of Genomics, Evolution and Development</a>. Previously I worked at the Brazilian Institute for Space Research developing tools for a coupled general circulation model and training research staff in basic tools and processes (version control, testing and the SciPy stack). I also spent some time in industry, working in the API team of a whitelabel product for files and contacts synchronization. I learned a lot about code review, unit testing and continuous integration during this time, and how agile processes work with larger teams.
