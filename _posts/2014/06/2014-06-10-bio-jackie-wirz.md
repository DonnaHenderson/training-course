I'm a professional oddball! I have a PhD in Biochemistry, and worked in the areas of collagen biophysics and a little crystallography. I have transitioned out of the lab and into the library, where I do a lot of random and interesting things; I teach on data, data visualization, biochemistry, information literacy and research ethics, I do research on the information gathering habits of scientists, and I work closely with our graduate programs on designing new curricula and policies. I believe in evolution, Jane Eyre and salted caramel buttercream.
