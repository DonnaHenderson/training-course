This was my fourth attempt of the screencast. The first and second were way to long (9mins &#8211; 6 mins). The third attempt cut most of the introduction and excess explanation of subject matter(3.5 mins). Finally cut the first example of loading a csv file and focused on the download and loading of the DataFame from a restful api(2:55).
