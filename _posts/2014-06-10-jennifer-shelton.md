Hi, I am the K-INBRE Bioinformatics Core Outreach Coordinator. I work with the Beocat cluster in Kansas to train scientists and conduct our own Bioinformatics research. I develop pipelines to complete* de novo* transcriptome and genome assemblies, test for differential expression and assemble high throughput long molecule maps and use these maps to refine genome assemblies. In this course I hope to learn more about training scientists to code. By learning to train scientists more efficiently I hope to accelerate my own self-training. Teaching material for our summer workshop in next generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis for biologists can be found atÂ <a href="https://github.com/NGSAnalysisOnBeocatClass" target="_blank">https://github.com/NGSAnalysisOnBeocatClass</a> and <a href="http://bioinformaticskstateperl.blogspot.com/2014/05/beocat-with-unix-and-perl.html" target="_blank">http://bioinformaticskstateperl.blogspot.com/2014/05/beocat-with-unix-and-perl.html</a>. This is my first time organizing this workshop so feel free to make suggestions our comments.
