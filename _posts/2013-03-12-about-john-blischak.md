I am a graduate student in genetics at the University of Chicago. Briefly, I use genome-wide datasets to learn about gene regulatory processes. I have greatly improved the programming I do for my research by applying the principles I learned as a participant in a SWC bootcamp and hope to pass on these best practices to other scientists.
