These questions assess understanding of the basic loop structres, as outlined in &#8220;[Concept Map – Loops by Isabel Fenton][1]&#8221;

**How does a &#8220;do while&#8221; loop differ from a &#8220;while&#8221; loop?**

1.  A &#8220;do while&#8221; loop runs a code block before evaluating a condition, ensuring that the code runs at least once.
2.  A while loop evaluates a condition after running a code block, while a &#8220;do while&#8221; loop evaluates a condition before running a code block.
3.  There is no difference; a while loop is a simplified version of a &#8220;do while&#8221; loop.

**Replace the blanks in the following javascript code with the correct numbers to have the loop run three times and display a famous catchphrase.  
**  
<span style="font-family: monospace, san serif;">var catchPhrase =&#8221;&#8221;;<br /> for(var i=__; i<__; i++){<br /> catchPhrase+= &#8221; wakka&#8221;;<br /> }<br /> alert(catchPhrase+&#8221;!&#8221;);</span>
