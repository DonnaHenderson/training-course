I&#8217;m definitely the odd one out in this study group, but I suppose it&#8217;s only fair to introduce myself if I&#8217;m going to be participating.

I&#8217;m an editor and self-publishing consultant; I worked with Greg on the [AOSA][1] books, and most recently I edited and helped publish a book on [schizophrenia][2]. I&#8217;m now working with Greg on Software Carpentry. I have a personal interest in psychology, with a particular focus (lately) on learning and teaching. My background is in Math and CS &#8211; I have a math degree and I worked in software for about a decade.
