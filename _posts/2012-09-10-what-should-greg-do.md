Homework from the week 1 discussion:

*   Tracy, Ian and Ben: what should Greg do with concept maps in his course?
*   Everyone else: what else should Greg to in his course?

The aim is to come up with an interesting experiment: something new to try in the Software Carpentry workshops in York and Oslo.
