My name is Sebastian Raschka and I was born and raised in Germany, where I did my Bachelor&#8217;s degree in Biology (my thesis was in the area of developmental genetics) at Heinrich-Heine University, Duesseldorf. In 2011, I joined an exchange program with Michigan State University (East Lansing, Michigan), and after I received my Bachelor&#8217;s degree in Germany, I decided to come back to MSU to join a PhD program in Biochemistry, which recently became a Dual-Major degree: Computational Biology.

I always loved working and tinkering with computers, and thus I joined a computational protein structure analysis lab for my PhD thesis, where I work on software for protein-ligand docking and high-throughput drugÂ screening (i.e., small chemical compounds for targetting protein receptors).

In my free time I <a href="http://www.sebastianraschka.com" target="_blank">started blogging about programming and bioninformatics</a> and really enjoy my work. I am looking forward to the Software Carpentry workshop in Toronto now, and hope to acquire valuable skills that will help me to teach other scientists useful skills that can help them making more efficient progress in their research projects.
