One of the problems I find often is having to install Python packages required by some other Python application I want to run or I am developing: sometimes I end up messing my Python installation, or having conflicts with package versions. This happens also in teaching, when you need the students to install some specific package without messing their Python installations. virtualenv is a solution to this problem. In my screencast, I&#8217;m planning to cover virtualnev installation, creating a virtual environment, installing a package on it (&#8220;docopt&#8221;), unloading the environment and returning back to &#8220;normal&#8221;, and finally reloading the environment later.

I&#8217;m sorry it&#8217;s not yet done, I&#8217;ll have it in a couple of days.
