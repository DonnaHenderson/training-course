Hi, I&#8217;m Isabelle. I&#8217;m a third year Ph.D. (Biology) student at Steve Kembel&#8217;s lab at Université du Québec à Montréal. Initially, I was trained in terrestrial ecology (functional ecology of Scots pine) and statistics. Starting my Ph.D., I became interested in the interactions between plants and microbes. My project focuses on the identification of leaf and root microbiome of temperate trees along a gradient of urbanism (from natural to extremely urban settings). I have been using R for a while now and I&#8217;ve been learning other languages to deal with the massive microbiological datasets. I love to teach and share my knowledge, but most of all I enjoy to learn from teaching.
