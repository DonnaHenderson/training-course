I am in Chicago working toward a doctoral thesis in applied math concerning tensor computations.  Aside from that I write in R for a computational biology group and also teach kids in extracurricular programs.  I am keenly interested in all things bearing on the psychology, philosophy, and history of empiricism, mathematics, and learning.
