I&#8217;m passionate about building communities, working and engaging with others to achieve goals, share experiences and best practice. I have been working in the past years in Bioinformatics training, particularly with the current topics of Next Generation Sequencing, OMICs and bridging the gap between biologists and computational researchers.
