I am an environmental microbiologist turned into environmental engineer. Currently I&#8217;m a post-doc at Iowa State University studying soil microbial activities in the peatland ecosystems. I use shell, python and R to analyze metagenomic data and hope to improve my own understanding of scientific computing through teaching.
