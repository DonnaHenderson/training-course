I&#8217;m a PhD student for Computer Vision at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. I am interested in good, reusable, reproducible and open scientific software, which is what the Software Carpentry is all about. I hope to learn some new skills, get to know some nice people, and maybe even host a Boot Camp at my institute <img src="http://localhost:8080/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
