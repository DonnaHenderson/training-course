I&#8217;m an associate professor in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at the University of Western Ontario. I&#8217;m an observational astrophysicist who uses as many telescopes as possible to study nearby galaxies. I have been writing Python code for more than 10 years but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m good at it (or teaching anyone else to do it) yet..
