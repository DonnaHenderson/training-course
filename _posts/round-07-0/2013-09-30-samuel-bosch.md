I&#8217;m a master in Geography with a few years of experience as a software developer in the GIS industry. Now I&#8217;m pursuing a PhD in Biology at the University of Ghent (Belgium). I work on marine species distribution modeling. My webpage/blog (samuelbosch.com) is out of date but I have plans to revive it.
