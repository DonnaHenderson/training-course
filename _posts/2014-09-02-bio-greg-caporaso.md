I&#8217;m an assistant professor in the Biological Sciences department at Northern Arizona University. I teach two courses per year in bioinformatics: [one at the undergraduate level][1], and [one at the graduate level][2]. I additionally do a lot of bioinformatics open source software development (some of my projects include [QIIME][3] and [scikit-bio][4]), and recently have been working on an open access, interactive bioinformatics textbook called [An Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics][5]. I&#8217;m planning a lot of development time on that book over the next year, so this seems like a good time to learn more about teaching from this SC course.
