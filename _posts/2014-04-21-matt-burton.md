Hey Folks, I am a doctoral candidate at the University of Michigan School of Information where I do computational social science and digital humanities. My research involves studying new forms of scholarly communication, specifically blogs, using computational and qualitative methods. Once upon a time I got a degree in bioinformatics, worked in information security, and was a software developer. I&#8217;ve taught git to Shakespearean scholars, latent dirichlet allocation to librarians,Â and will be running a computational social science summer camp at U of M this summer.
