I was thinking of doing a short (< 3 mins) explanation of how to do a relatively simple integration by parts for someone who is rusty with integration.

I feel it will be suitable as it can be done fairly quickly and simply but is not totally trivial. I intend recapping a bit about how the technique is derived from the product rule of differentiation (which most people can dredge up from the past!) and then show an example step by step. I will terminate with some tips on how to choose the splitting into parts to give the simplest and quickest solution.

What do you think?
