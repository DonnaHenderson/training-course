Hot on the heels of [Cait Pickens&#8217; posts][1] about our workshop at the Scripps Institute comes [this post-mortem][2] from Titus Brown. Again, there&#8217;s lots of good analysis, and many useful recommendationsâ€”particularly concerning installation and setup headaches (which continue to be our second-biggest problem).
