1. Consider the following python script:  
a = 3  
c = 1  
b = 2  
c = a  
a = a + 1  
b = 5  
d = 3*c + a + b  
print d

Which of the following matches the output?  
(a) d = 8  
(b) d = 18  
(c) d = 21  
(d) d = 17

2. What is the output of this script? (make sure each character can be read clearly)  
phrase = &#8216;the brown dog&#8217;  
print &#8216;[&#8216; + phrase[2:-3] + &#8216;]&#8217;
