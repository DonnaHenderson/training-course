I&#8217;ve started putting together an [instructor&#8217;s guide][1] for Software Carpentryâ€”something chapter-length that summarizes key points from educational research and how they apply to what we&#8217;re teaching. As part of the final exercise for each cohort, I&#8217;ll be asking people what they&#8217;ve learned from this study group (or elsewhere) that *isn&#8217;t* in there.
