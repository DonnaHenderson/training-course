As Mark Guzdial discusses in [this post][1], &#8220;an expert teacher has (1) discipline knowledge, (2) understanding about teaching and learning, (3) understanding of conceptual barriers that students face in the discipline, and (4) a set of effective strategies for addressing those conceptual barriers.&#8221; Parts 3 and 4 are called *pedagogical content knowledge* (PCK), and as Mark points out, a lot of people discount their importance. (In fact, a lot of people implicitly discount #2 as well: just think about how few professors have ever bothered to learn anything about learning, or how few Silicon Valley ed-tech startups have anyone with a teaching background on staff.) A recent article in <cite>Communications of the ACM</cite> calls for the creation of [methods courses][2] to teach people the PCK of computing, but I think it&#8217;s a chicken-and-egg problem: most people won&#8217;t learn more about it until they care about it, but won&#8217;t care about it until they learn more.
