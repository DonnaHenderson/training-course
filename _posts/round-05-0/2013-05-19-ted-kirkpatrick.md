I&#8217;m an associate professor of computing science at the Surrey campus of Simon Fraser University.  We&#8217;re just down the road from Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada. I received my Ph.D. in 2001 with a specialty in human-computer interaction. I&#8217;ve tired of the inbred nature of much computing research (specialists writing for other specialists) and I&#8217;m interested in teaching Software Carpentry as a way to make computing accessible to people outside the field.
