I am doing a post-doc at the space-weather group at the <a href="http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/" target="_blank">Finnish Meteorological Institute</a>. My PhD is in Solar Physics but after that I&#8217;ve been getting more and more specialised in data processing, heliospheric data archives and event catalogues.  One of the task I&#8217;ve been doing most is to implement other scientists&#8217; code into a grid infrastructure.  That demonstrated me that we don&#8217;t have enough formation as programmers &#8211; that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here, to learn how to teach my colleagues the best practices.  In my opinion, &#8220;sharing&#8221; is a must on science.
