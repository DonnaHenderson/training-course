I am a Research Technician at HHMI-JFRC with a *Drosophila* genetics background. At JFRC, I am part of the Project Technical Resources group, through which I am contracted out to do work for various projects and labs at Janelia Farm. The majority of my work is designing, running, curating data, and analyzing data from high-throughput behavioral assays, but I also help others automate their workflow and data analysis. I primarily use shell scripting, perl, and MATLAB, but I am trying to transition into Python and R for some applications.
