I am a PhD student at UC Berkeley in the Psychology department and my research involves building [computational models of cognition][1] to better understand human behavior. I love helping others attain the computational skills I find so useful, and I occasionally post pedagogical entries on my [blog][2] about Python, Emacs, Git, etc.
