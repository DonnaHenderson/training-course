[Motivation for learning to write functions in R][1]

**Demotivation**

In my first year of undergrad, I took an honors course called &#8220;The Academic Habit&#8221;.  The idea was simple and fairly appealing: attend four academic or cultural events on campus and write a short essay about them.  I went to a couple of plays and other cultural events and got good marks on my essays despite putting very little effort into them.  Then I went to a really fascinating talk about evolutionary medicine, which got me very excited about the topic.  I put considerably more effort into that essay, talking about the implications of the research for the future of medicine, and how an evolutionary approach to a number of biological issues in the real world (antibiotic and pesticide resistance, epidemiology, etc.) could save us a lot of trouble in the future.  Despite all the extra work I got an unsatisfactory mark on that essay, because I concentrated on the science rather than the aesthetics of the presentation.  The grader said that they didn&#8217;t want to read about the topic itself, they wanted to hear about how well the presenter spoke and whether his slides were appropriate for the audience and things like that.  This was tremendously demotivating to me for several reasons: first, I felt like I was penalized for doing extra work on something I was excited about.  Second, there was never any discussion in the syllabus or class meetings about concentrating on the presentation, rather than the content, of seminars.  Finally, when I challenged the grading of the essay, I was simply told that the grade would stand without any justification given.  The end result was that the one bad grade I had in that class was from the only assignment I did that had any lasting value for me.
