Hello! My name is Atul, and I work on the design and engineering of educational experiences on the Webmaker Community Team at the Mozilla Foundation. In recent years, I have worked on projects like [Lightbeam][1], [Web X-Ray Goggles][2], and [Open Badges][3].

My blog is at [toolness.com][4], and I go by *toolness* on [Twitter][5], [Github][6], and most other services.

If you&#8217;d like to know more, you can check out the [mini resume][7] I recently wrote for applying to mentor at [mouse][8].
