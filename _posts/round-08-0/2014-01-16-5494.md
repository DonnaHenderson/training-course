I am Sheldon McKay, a bioinformatics consultant with the Reactome database at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research.  My background is in evolutionary genetics and genomics.  I have been working in bioinformatics for a while, and have been involved in the WormBase, ModENCODE, Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD), BioPerl and iPlant projects.  The past few years, I have been doing quite a bit of outreach work through GMOD and iPlant and I am interested in learning how to become a better bioinformatics trainer.
