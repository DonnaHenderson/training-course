Hello! I am a graduate student in Cognitive Neuroscience at McGill University (Montreal, Quebec). I study auditory motor integration in cello players using functional magnetic resonance imaging. My long term goal is to help develop brain imaging analysis software, but for now I am working on learning good coding practices and getting better at introducing people to the magical world of computer programming.
