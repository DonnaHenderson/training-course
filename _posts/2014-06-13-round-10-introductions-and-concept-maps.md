Group 10 had its inaugural online meeting this week &#8211; almost 40 people joined us to take a look at what we&#8217;ll be covering in the next 12-14 weeks. As a rough outline, we will be covering:

*   Introductions: novice vs. competent practitioner vs. expert
*   Concept maps as a design and communication tool
*   Formative vs. summative assessment and reverse instructional design
*   Five minutes of fame
*   Motivation and demotivation
*   Collaborative lesson development
*   Showtime

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">For Our Next Meeting (Wednesday, June 25)</span>

1.  Pick a topic that you think you could teach novices in 5-10 minutes. 
    *   Related to computing, but doesn&#8217;t have to be programming: how to test a GUI or how to sort values in Excel would be fine.
2.  Draw a *concept map* for that topic. 
    *   Bubbles for ideas, labelled links to show how those ideas are connected.
    *   Hand-drawn/low-fidelity so that you can iterate faster, and so that feedback will be more honest.
    *   Here are some [slides by James Neill][1], and [some][2] [examples][3] [from][4] [previous][5] [trainees][6].
    *   Post a picture of your concept map to the blog by Wednesday, June 18.
    *   Then comment on at least half a dozen other people&#8217;s concept maps before Wednesday, June 25.
    *   Because one of the goals of the exercise is to get comfortable giving and receiving feedback on teaching and teaching materials.
3.  Please also read the first two chapters of *How Learning Works*.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notes</span>**

*   Educational psych &#8211; how brains learn 
    *   Doesn&#8217;t limit teaching methods, many teaching options.
    *   individual-based educational psychology (will be our focus)
*   Instructional design &#8211; effectiveness of teaching techniques 
    *   Example: whole language vs phonics (top down vs. bottom up) 
        *   (phonics has the advantage of giving rewards along the way)
        *   Statistically neither is better. The most important factor was teacher enthusiasm
    *   which one is better? depends on the enthusiasm of the teacher
*   3 &#8220;stages of knowledge&#8221;: 
    *   **novice**:**they don&#8217;t know what they don&#8217;t know**, they try to fit partial knowledge into different (existing), wrong &#8220;boxes&#8221; (incorrect mental model), end up having misconceptions &#8211;> more information, greater confusion
    *   Important to teach a correct mental model
    *   Need to build a concept structure to hold new knowledge 
        *   asking questions based on preexisting mental categories; the question itself doesn&#8217;t really make sense
        *   example teach only 15 commands in the first class (in 3 hours)
    *   authentic task 
        *   bait and switch ( training on topics that are relevant) e.g. loading a dataset and finding an error in an actual typical dataset
    *   Key approach: minimize knowledge presented
    *   most important thing with teaching a novice is giving them the appropriate working structural/mental model
    *   teach key concepts, then fill in details 
        *   Problem: people only interested in achieving &#8216;concrete task&#8217;
    *   **competent practitioner** 
        *   hours logged not = to expert
        *   connections among facts distinguish them from experts, not knowledge
    *   **expert** 
        *   density of **connections**between facts they know
        *   do and ponder
        *   is most probably a bad teacher
        *   Experts can shift between different paradigms easily 
            *   **Reflective practice (cycle of &#8220;do&#8221; and &#8220;ponder&#8221;)**:Can critique own work (feedback loop) 
                *   stage 1: get feedback
                *   stage 2: give feedback
                *   stage 3: give yourself feedback
                *   &#8216;bootstrapping&#8217; that leads to expertise 
                    *   e.g. code review; peer &#8216;mentoring&#8217;
*   Concept map (appendix a or b in text) &#8211; which ideas are related to which other ideas? 
    *   vs. notes &#8211; don&#8217;t pre-commit to specific ordering, connects ideas
    *   A good teacher will explicitly connect new concepts to existing concepts / skills
    *   More connected facts &#8211; more likely they will be remembered
    *   Not just useful in lesson prep &#8211; can also be helpful to write it up on the whiteboard in a lesson to reinforce what you&#8217;re describing
    *   points notes implicitly impose an order
*   Homework: 5-10 min presentation about technical task (more info in a blog post) 
    *   *hand draw* a concept map and post to blog by **Wednesday** next week (June 18), then comment on at least half a dozen others
    *   read two first chapters of &#8220;How learning works&#8221; before next meeting
    *   Advantages of drawing a &#8216;rough&#8217; prototype: More likely to get honest feedback (if polished, harder to critique)
*   Advantages of reflective practice: 
    *   Bootstrap expertise
    *   Build community
*   Working memory &#8211; fast but limited 
    *   ~7 ideas can be held at the same time (e.g. phone number length)
    *   Teaching (novices) broken into 5-10 minute blocks with few ideas that are then reinforced.
