[Round 2.4][1]

<http://people.mbi.ucla.edu/leec/docs/socraticqs/tutorial.html>

Agenda:

*   What did you learn about your chosen topic?
*   Did you change your question based on your attempts to diagnose wrong answers?
*   How long did it take to come up with two good questions?
*   Does this approach scale?
*   What else do you (think you) need to know before you start leading boot camps?

Lex:

*   two questions: permissions and sorting
*   got one wrong himself
*   went back to first question and changed input to get four different answers
*   second one: struggling to find more than two wrong ones
*   found this a difficult exercise: hard to keep things simple (always tending toward complexity)
*   Spent an hour to an hour and a half
*   Karin&#8217;s comment: can crowdsource it

Steve

*   cheated: used questions and wrong answers drawn from exam scripts he was marking
*   20-30 minutes to do, but thinking about it in the background for a week
*   suggestion: take notes during boot camps of what people are getting wrong

Ariel

*   Q: does anonymity matter in asking questions in this context?
*   A: yes &#8211; people feel shy
*   During recent workshop, had people post questions anonymously on a wall
*   Requiring people to do things lowers the threshold on coming up with something

Karin

*   took longer than anticipated: an hour for Q1, several hours for Q2 (thinking, not doing)
*   had to flip it over: couldn&#8217;t begin to think about question, but rather had to start with what I wanted to figure out/diagnose
*   hard to remember &#8220;beginner&#8217;s mind&#8221;
*   doesn&#8217;t scale done solo, would scale crowdsourcing

Ted

*   hard to come up with wrong answers
*   first two was an hour and change, later questions would take more time (easy ones taken)

*Homework: write a final post about this class. What did you learn? What worked well? What could we improve? What did you want to learn that we didn&#8217;t cover? Please post as &#8220;Round 2.5&#8243;, and thank you for taking part.
