**2013-01-18 Meeting of the Software Carpentry Study Group**

**Agenda:**

*   What we learned from stories
*   Peer instruction and concept tests

Ariel had trouble understanding some stories

*   Sequencing story depended on things that had come before
*   But the one about regular expressions was easier to follow

One of the things that struck Greg was that the concept maps for the stories were broad

*   Good to show tying things together
*   Bad in that it makes it less likely that others will fully follow them
*   Do we think this is useful in the context of a 2 day SWC bootcamp?
*   Can/should we build towards an overarching &#8220;project&#8221;?
*   Problem with overarching projects: difficult to shuffle things around around teachers schedules
*   Students may get lost
*   Having stories worked out in advance with a specific end point can make them more concise and useful. What is the point of this story?

**Assignment:**

*   Come up with a couple of multiple choice questions
*   Each introduces a new idea or tool
*   e.g., having seen cut and head and tail, how do you accomplish task X
*   1 answer is right, others are plausibly wrong
*   For each wrong answer write 1-2 sentences on what the student doesn&#8217;t understand if they choose that wrong answer
*   Wrong answers have a diagnostic purpose-would tell the teacher what people don&#8217;t understand
*   Very short
*   Peer instruction &#8211; pose question, vote, discuss, see answer, discuss
*   Post to blog under category 2.4 by Feb 1st
*   Read and comment on everybody else&#8217;s questions before meeting week of Feb 4-8
*   See &#8220;Challenges&#8221; in [shell.html][1] for some alpha-quality examples of questions (without explanations of the plausibly-wrong answers)
