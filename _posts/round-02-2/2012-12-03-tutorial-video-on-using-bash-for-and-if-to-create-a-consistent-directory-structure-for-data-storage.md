Sorry to be so late getting this up. The video ended up being longer than intended, so this is only the first part.

Where I work, data management is often an issue and being able to move your data into a consistent directory structure is important. This video uses Bash to create a directory structure for data use and storage. Let me know if you would like me to post the rest of the video.
