These are related to my concept map on python dictionaries.

1.  You have executed the following line of code in python to create a dictionary:

d = {&#8216;name&#8217; : &#8216;Matthew&#8217;, &#8216;computer&#8217; : &#8216;Mac&#8217;, 1 : &#8216;complete&#8217;, 2 : &#8216;incomplete&#8217;}

Which of the following lines of code would give an error if you executed them?

a)  print d[&#8216;name&#8217;]  
b)  print d[&#8216;Mac&#8217;]  
c)  print d[&#8216;computer&#8217;] + &#8216;book&#8217;  
d)  print d[0]  
e)  b and d  
f)  b, c, and d

2.  Which of the following are valid dictionary assignment statements in python?

a)  d[ (3, 4, [5, 6]) ] = (8, 7)  
b)  d[ (1, 3, (9, 10)) ] = [4, 7, (8, 9)]  
c)  d[ lambda x : x ] = lambda x : x**2  
d)  a and b  
e)  b and c  
f)  a and c
