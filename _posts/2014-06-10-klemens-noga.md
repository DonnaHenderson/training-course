My name is Klemens Noga and I work in [Academic Computer Centre Cyfronet AGH][1] located in Krakow, Poland. My area of responsibility include user and technical support for scientific users of our HPC centre and the <a title="PL-Grid Infrastructure" href="http://www.plgrid.pl/en" target="_blank">PL-Grid Infrastructure</a>. Moreover I train users in effective usage of HPC systems and also provide outreach for potential and new users.

I&#8217;ve studied [Interdisciplinary Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences][2] at<a title="Jagiellonian University" href="http://www.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/" target="_blank"> Jagiellonian University</a> also located in Krakow, which is the oldest university in Poland and celebrates the 650th years <a href="http://www.650.uj.edu.pl/en/" target="_blank">jubilee</a> this year. I&#8217;ve got Msc degree in Theoretical Chemistry and I&#8217;m finishing my doctoral thesis from computational chemistry about electronic interactions in mixed-valence compounds of molybdenum.

Moreover I&#8217;m bike activist and member of Krakow Miastem Rowerów society (in English: Krakow &#8211; City of Bicycles) which fights for better bike and pedestrian infrastructure. Recently we have held annual big bicycle festival called <a href="http://www.krakow.swietocykliczne.pl/" target="_blank">Święto Cykliczne</a> (in English: Cyclic Festival) which crested last Sunday with Great Bicycle Ride (about 3 thousand riders) and Final Picnic on the grounds of <a title="Museum of Polish Aviation" href="http://www.muzeumlotnictwa.pl/indexen.php" target="_blank">Museum of Polish Aviation</a> (one of the best aviation museums in the whole world). I&#8217;m also mediocre climber, enthusiastic hiker, history enthusiast and beer geek. Therefore usually I&#8217;m bit out of focus .-)

I hope this training course give me knowledge how to become better teacher.
