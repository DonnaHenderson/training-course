I&#8217;m a plant systematist and evolutionary biologist currently doing postdoctoral work in software development and infrastructure for biology. As a researcher I operate at the interface of computational methodology and large scale phylogenetics. I&#8217;m interested in addressing broad evolutionary questions related to the origin and maintenance of all kind of organismal diversity. I often make use of public resources like GenBank and GBIF to provide broadly-scoped data, and I program in Python, Java, and R (and dabble in C/C++) to develop analysis pipelines and tools for use by myself and other biologists.

I have several years of experience teaching undergraduate science lab courses, and several additional years doing individualized tutoring in math and science, but no formal training in teaching. I&#8217;m looking forward to this course, where I hope to improve my understanding of teaching methodology and fill in gaps in my ability to make information accessible to students with different learning modes and capabilities.
