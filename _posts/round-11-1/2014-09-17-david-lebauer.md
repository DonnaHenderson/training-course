**My scientific interests** are focused on biogeochemistry and nutrient cycling. I utilize field observations and experimental results to develop and evaluate ecophysiological models. I then use models to predict how carbon, nitrogen, and water cycles will be affected by global change and agriculture. Ultimately, I plan to apply knowledge of these interactions to the development and management of efficient and sustainable ecosystems.

**I am a research scientist** at the University of Illinois, where I lead an ecosystem modeling program within the Energy Biosciences Institute. Our objective is to understand and predict the productivity and functioning of ecosystems managed for biofuel feedstock production. These systems are ideal &#8216;model organisms&#8217; because they are more data rich and homogeneous than unmanaged ecosystems. To support this work, I develop software tools that support integration of heterogeneous information using Bayesian model-data synthesis.

**My motivation for taking this course** is to become a more effective teacher and a better informed practitioner of modern science. As a teacher and role model, I hope to build a community of practitioners with the skills and motivation to conduct more efficient, cumulative, and collaborative research.
