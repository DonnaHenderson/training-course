I am software engineer at Mozilla involved into investigating and fixing performance and power bottlenecks of Firefox by exploiting the data collected from our Telemetry system. I work mainly with C++, Python, Javascript and Clojure(script).

Before that I worked for the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab where I implemented and optimised part of the software infrastructure used to analyse the data collected from the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. Over the years spent working for CERN I have very much enjoyed helping physicists improve their productivity by showing them simple tools like git or tmux, or introducing them to design patterns.

I have a MS in Computer Science from the University of Pisa.
