Hi, I&#8217;m an unemployed librarian with my Master in Library and Information Studies from Dalhousie University (Halifax, Canada) and my Bachelor of Arts & Science from McMaster University (Hamilton, Canada).

In my undergraduate degree I focused in psychology and did my honours thesis on treatment for chronic pain in people with acquired brain injuries.  I also founded and was on the planning committee for a student conference on interdisciplinary education ([Combining Two Cultures][1]).

As a librarian, my experience has been in academic libraries doing reference and instruction &#8212; answering questions and giving tutorials on everything from citation to the wifi.  Over the past year, I managed a major university library&#8217;s move to a new WordPress site, an experience I am still recovering from.  Most of my expertise is in web design and database systems rather than straight-up programming, especially in the areas of usability and accessibility.

I like teaching myself new useful things, so I&#8217;ve been learning Japanese for the past two years. I&#8217;m currently residing in Florida but will probably be back in Canada soon, employment willing.
