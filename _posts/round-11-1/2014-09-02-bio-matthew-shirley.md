As a postdoc at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, in the department of Oncology, I write software for second-generation sequencing data analysis using Python and a small bit of C. I&#8217;ve lectured in courses on scientific computing for the FAES and Hopkins Center for Computational Biology, but this will be my first time actually learning how to teach effectively.
