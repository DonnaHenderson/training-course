I am a Master&#8217;s student at Clemson University, South Carolina, and I&#8217;m a researcher in high performance computational fluid dynamics. I also teach programming to undergraduate and graduate students, typically in short, one-off sessions. Before Software Carpentry, I used *ad hoc* teaching methods&#8212;and materials&#8212;that were somewhat arbitrary, seemingly with some success.

Applying the principles I&#8217;m learning here is clearly improving the efficacy of my sessions &#8211; I can see this from the feedback I receive! Also, applying *evidence-based* methods and developing teaching material accordingly allows me to be confident that I&#8217;m teaching the right things in the right way. I&#8217;m looking forward to learning more from you, and I&#8217;m ever-grateful to SWC for making me a better researcher and a better teacher
