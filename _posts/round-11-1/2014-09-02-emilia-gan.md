I am a graduate student at the University of Washington, Seattle (Pathobiology). I am finding that I am most interested in the bioinformatics aspects of my research. I am currently working on learning more R and Python. Before starting graduate school, I taught part time at a local community college, and I plan on teaching again in the future. I am looking forward to learning how to be a more effective teacher. Earlier this year, I volunteered at a &#8220;Learn to Program&#8221; workshop using Python (which I&#8217;d barely started learning at the time), and I was very happy to see that even with my basic level of knowledge, I was able to help others get started. That experience was the motivation behind signing up for this training.
