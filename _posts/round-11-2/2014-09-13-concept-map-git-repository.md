## Introducing the git repository

This is a concept map for the notion of a &lsquo;git repository&rsquo;. I would anticipate the notion to take 10 minutes or so of class time, half an half instructor talking and attendees talking, plus or minus five minutes.

This is *just* about what a repository is, with some lead-ins to how it gets used, but not about making one or actually using one. Git could (maybe should) be replaceable by &lsquo;cardboard box&rsquo;.

This would be part of the Introducing Version Control lesson at
