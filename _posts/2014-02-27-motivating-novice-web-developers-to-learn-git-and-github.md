In the front-end web development course I&#8217;m teaching right now, teaching Git and GitHub took far longer than we expected. We were trying to teach command line basics, how to initialize a repo etc., but kept getting blocked on &#8220;But why are we doing this?&#8221; type questions every step of the way. For GUI users, something like learning to change directories in the shell seemed completely pointless.

Next time I teach this lesson, I&#8217;d motivate learners before getting into the details in a couple ways. First, I&#8217;d tell them about the importance of version control. I&#8217;d ask the class if anyone has ever been working on a project that was going well, then blew up when they tried to change or add something &#8211; after trying lots of different thing, your code became a big huge mess and you have no idea how to get back to before you started the mess. Chances are this has happened to at least a few students. Regardless, I&#8217;d tell them that I&#8217;d certainly been in that situation before. Then I&#8217;d pitch the idea of a magical &#8220;reset button&#8221; that could bring you back to where you were before the mess started &#8211; version control.

Second, I&#8217;d talk about the importance of GitHub to a web developer&#8217;s career. In this industry, you&#8217;re primarly judged on your work, so a GitHub profile with lots of code on it is a great way to showcase your skills to potential employers and fellow developers. GitHub also facilitates collaboration. Web developers love to help and share &#8211; it&#8217;s one of my favourite things about this industry &#8211; so learning to use Git and GitHub will allow others to contribute to your projects and for you to give back to the community by contribution to other people&#8217;s projects.
