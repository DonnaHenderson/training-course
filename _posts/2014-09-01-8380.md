I am professor in the Atmospheric Science department at Texas A&M University. My research involves numerical modeling of climate using supercomputers. I teach introductory programming to meteorology undergrads, with an emphasis on data visualization. I taught IDL for 3 years but have switched to teaching Python during the last two years. Â I find that student performance often follows a bimodal probability distribution in the intro programming courses, unlike other courses I teach, where student performance follows a typical bell curve!

I also dabble in open source software. My most recent project involves creating a browser-based virtual computer lab for collaborative instruction (using [GraphTerm][1]).
