Notes:

*   You might consider merging intro segment with the subsequent tutorial segment.
*   Scattered through the lectures were several questions left “as an exercise” to students. However, in the context of a video lecture this gets buried/ignored. I would think that most people blow right by these and don’t actually have time to ponder them. Perhaps these should be at the end of the video, along with pointers to the answers. In other words, provide some opportunity to correct misconceptions.
*   The pacing was a little quick. Think about slowing things down,
*   I would rather have gone through a simple HTML based tutorial, especially for the initial introduction. I’m not sure that the video format added much. Live coding, or some kind of slow reveal in the slides might have helped. Otherwise you are looking at a mass of text on the slides, that you can read directly. There was some of this slow reveal in the Linear Algebra section (3:33) &#8211; would like to see more of it throughout the lecture.
*   I really liked the last segment on building a recommendation engine. Would rather see the entire series of lectures build this example from the ground up, introducing concepts along the way. The first few lectures were akin to man pages, and less useful as video lectures.
*   Rename the last segment to “Example &#8211; Building a Recommendation Engine”.
*   It would be really nice to have the slides below the video in text format, so that one could cut-and-paste the code examples
*   Indentation is off in lecture 5, slide 9 (“ratings = …” not properly indented)
