I intend to cover the basics of working with numpy arrays efficiently in terms of using ufuncs and similar functionality. The idea will be to introduce students to the concept of &#8216;vectorized&#8217; operations as a way of writing efficient code vs explicit looping over array elements.

Unfortunately, I will not be able to produce and post the video in time for the deadline since there is various chaos occurring including a promotion talk. I hope to get it done sometime soon though and will post it as soon as I can.
