My name is Sam Popowich, and I&#8217;m the Discovery Systems Librarian at the University of Alberta. I&#8217;ve been involved with programming in libraries for around five years, and I&#8217;m interested in helping to promote and train librarians and library staff to code, to be more productive and have more control over the work they do. I&#8217;m also an organizer of the Edmonton chapter of Code4Lib.
