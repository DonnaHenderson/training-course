Ross got a doctorate in computational chemistry in the 1990s, then decided he liked making software more than he liked applying for research grants.  So he went into industry.  Then back to academia.  A couple of times.  Currently he&#8217;s working with [ACEnet][1] in Halifax, Nova Scotia, helping academics apply cluster computing to their research problems.
