I am a self-taught bioinformatician working with high-throughput sequencing data at Oslo University, Norway. My main project is the assembly of the Atlantic cod genome from short pieces of sequence information. I mainly use unix (shell, awk, a little sed) and perl &#8211; but due to the software carpentry course I am in the process of switching to python. I also teach these langauges locally, and are interested in setting up a local swcarpentry workshop.

Besides doing science, I enjoy supervising master and PhD students, teaching, and helping others make sense of large datasets.

I am officially employed by the Norwegian Sequencing Centre, a national Norwegian core facility, responsible for bioinformatics and infrastructure associated with the technologies we provide. I am an avid blogger and use twitter for my work.
