Hi everyone, I&#8217;m an assistant professor in the Wildlife department at Humboldt State University. I&#8217;m primarily interested in the limits to species distributions, and I&#8217;ve got current projects working with giant kangaroo rats, white-footed voles, and porcupines. Students (both undergraduate and graduate) in our department are dying to get additional experience working with R, Python, and data management. While I&#8217;ve been programming for over 20 years, and teaching for almost 7, I don&#8217;t have a lot of experience teaching others how to program. I&#8217;ve heard great things about Software Carpentry boot camps, and I look forward to learning this pedagogical approach.
