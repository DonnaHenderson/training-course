Dan Meyer&#8217;s latest post, titled &#8220;[Tweet-Sized Tasks][1]&#8220;, presents some very short descriptions of interesting math problems:

*   You&#8217;re standing at one wall in a room. You have to touch every other wall in order and return to your first spot. What&#8217;s the shortest path?
*   At what exact time does the minute hand cross over the hour hand? Find all occurrences to the nearest second.

and so on. My immediate reaction was, &#8220;Neat!&#8221; followed by, &#8220;Hm&#8230; What are some interesting tweetable programming problems?&#8221;
