I&#8217;m a postdoctoral fellow at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. I work in the dermatology branch on a skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma, applying computational techniques to high throughput genomic data. I primarily use R, Python, and many of the open source bioinformatics tools available for genomic data analysis. I learned Python while in graduate school at the University of California, Irvine, and attended a PyCon while I was there. I enjoy informally teaching others about reproducible data analysis. I&#8217;m obsessed with coffee and train often in taekwondo.
