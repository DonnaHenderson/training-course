Hi all! I&#8217;m a graduate student in the department of Human Genetics at the University of Chicago, where my interests involve investigating the microbiome using high throughput sequencing (aka: lots-of-data-generating) technology. I came into grad school knowing almost nothing about programming and completely nothing about good programming practices. I hope to refine my teaching skills and of course learn more about computing myself along the way.
