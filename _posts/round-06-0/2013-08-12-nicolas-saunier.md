I am an assistant professor in Transportation Engineering at Polytechnique Montreal. I have a background in Computer Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in particular. I apply computational methods for transportation data collection and processing, in particular for road safety diagnosis. I have taught Java in 2003-2004 as a PhD student, and I now teach traffic engineering at the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as an introductory undergraduate transportation data management course that tries to make transportation engineers more &#8220;computer-savvy&#8221; and aware of the possibilities of data processing automation. The field of transportation is very late in adopting new computer technologies and prone to over-paying for proprietary closed systems, while it is on the verge of being profoundly transformed by automation at every level, in particular by driverless vehicles.
