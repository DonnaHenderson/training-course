In the early stages of learning R, I found its interactivity to be  conducive to bad programming habits. Having taken a more systematic approach to things (more use of functions, proper testing, etc.), I find I am getting more predictable results and more control over the environment.

To that end, I have started using the following two R packages which help automate some good practices:

**testthat** (http://bit.ly/St2pRd):  a formal testing environment developed by Hadley Wickham.

**ProjectTepmlate** (http://bit.ly/d6NbOF): creates a hierarchy of folders within an R project to organize data, code, test cases, etc. Not exactly the same as the excellent &#8220;A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects,&#8221; (****http://bit.ly/AADX8F) but very much in the same spirit.
