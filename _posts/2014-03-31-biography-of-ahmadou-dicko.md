I am a trained econometrician doing a PhD in climate change economics in Dakar (Senegal). I believe in reproducible research for which I use a lot R, Emacs (org-mode) and Github.

I also think that researchers and students in Africa will benefit a lot from using FOSS tools if they have the proper training and Software Carpentry is an unique opportunity to spread this kind of knowledge for a large audience.
