Dan Meyer's latest post, titled "[Tweet-Sized Tasks][1]", presents some very short descriptions of interesting math problems:

*   You're standing at one wall in a room. You have to touch every other wall in order and return to your first spot. What's the shortest path?
*   At what exact time does the minute hand cross over the hour hand? Find all occurrences to the nearest second.

and so on. My immediate reaction was, "Neat!" followed by, "Hm... What are some interesting tweetable programming problems?"
