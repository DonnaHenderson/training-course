**2013-01-18 Meeting of Group 3**

Our work: <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/category/round-3-1/>

**Agenda:**

*   What did you learn about concept maps and multiple-choice questions from other people&#8217;s work?
*   Would you now use either/both in teaching?

Our concept maps are a kind of scaffolding for learners.

Greg: when given to learners as handouts, concept maps often grow (they add extra nodes and arcs for things that instructors didn&#8217;t think of). Could collect these at the end to assess learning, but Greg has never done this. Try to experiment with using concept maps as you teach.

(See also [Titus Brown on minute cards][1].)

Next round: looking at mastery (see [Round 1.3][2])

1.  Refer to Chapter 4 of How Learning Works
2.  Pick a small topic (different from both your first round, or those used in [Round 1.3][2]).
3.  Make a table of: 
    1.  what does a novice know coming in (including misconceptions!)
    2.  what does a competent person know leaving the workshop
    3.  what does an expert know

When posted, nominate someone else from the group to make a longer response. Please post in category &#8220;Round 3.2&#8243; by Feb 22; we will meet on Feb 27 or 28.

Please also have a look at [this article][3] about the Finnish school system. (If you like dry books, you may also enjoy [this][4]). There is a [YouTube video][5] as well.
