Via Larry Cuban [1], I stumbled across the [Hope Survey][1], which attempts to measure how hopeful students are about academic outcomes. (See their &#8220;[Supporting Research][2]&#8221; page for a much better summary than that.) As you&#8217;ll all know from *How Learning Works*, believing that you can succeed has a tremendous impact on *whether* you succeed; the Hope Survey is focused on grade school, but I&#8217;m wondering whether we ought to steal some ideas from it and ask boot camp participants (before and after) how hopeful they are that they can do X, Y, or Z. Please read up a bit on their site, and add your thoughts in the comments below.
