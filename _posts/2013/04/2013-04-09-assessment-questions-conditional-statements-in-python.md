I wasn&#8217;t sure if we were supposed to stick to things on the map or other knowledge that we have, so I stuck to things on the map.

Distinguish novice from competent:  
1. Write a &#8216;for&#8217; loop with three if statements.  
2. Create a for loop for comparing two integers. How would you modify this loop to compare two strings? What would need to change?

Competent to expert:  
This is actually really hard.  
1. Given a set of three strings, how would you test if any of those strings appear in a filename, and bin the files according to string membership?  
2. I give you a list of objects in which some are integers, some are strings containing numbers (ie &#8216;4.0&#8217;) and some are floats. I want you to compare against a reference float. How would you handle type conversion? What are the strengths of your approach?
