1. I think that the main take-home for me was a very simple meta-lesson of the entire exercise: as in so many other things, developing a systematic reflective practice can also boost your teaching. What do I mean by that? I mean that in my previous experiences of preparation for teaching some particular material, the focus was usually on the material itself, implicitly assuming that if you know the material you also somehow know how to teach it. Even the mandatory TA training I took when I was in grad school focused on general statements about teaching, or &#8216;tricks&#8217; for how to teach better, rather than on a methodology of assessment and improvement of the teaching. In that respect reading the book was a useful reminder that teaching can be done according to a methodology. That it is important to gather and analyze the data about our teaching. That we can adopt in our teaching the kind of work-flow of experimenting, measuring, evaluating and incrementally improving, that is our mainstay as scientists in the lab.

2. A specific example that is particularly important for the technical stuff that we teach is  getting to know and think about the idea of  expert blindness. What students would understand from a particular way of explaining something.  Knowing what people don&#8217;t know and knowing what people need to know in order to follow a certain explanation. I am not particularly good at gauging what people know and so I think that I would benefit from experimenting more with evaluations of the kind we did in the last exercise. I also wonder how this can be done in the context of peer-, or student-mentoring in the lab, where I need to explain a certain process or idea to one other person. What questions would I need to ask to know &#8220;where to start explaining&#8221;.

3. Teaching stuff online: The format of our course was meetings over conference call or skype once every few weeks. I have a few points of feedback. First of all, sometimes there was no clear connection between the reading, the exercises we did and the discussions. It feels like we could spend more time with this. Maybe teaching these materials, and discussions on the SWC mailing list can be an opportunity to continue thinking about this.

Technical issues included scheduling, which often took at least a couple of weeks. Maybe it would have been possible to schedule all the meetings in advance at a regular time/day for some period? I am not sure whether that would have made scheduling easier or more difficult.

Another technical issue with some personal implications was that I felt that there was something slightly estranged about doing these over the phone. Maybe it would have been easier to communicate if we could see each other &#8211; even if all I had would have been a blurry pixelated image to attach to the names of the other participants. I imagine that would have been possible via skype, but they recently changed their service such that multi-party conference calls requires a paid subscription. An alternative could have been to meet over a hang-out on google+. This has similar facilities to the ether-pad (chat bar + google docs to write things up), and has the added benefit that you can see your interlocutors.

4. Thanks Greg for leading this and thanks to all the other participants for their inputs and time!
