I&#8217;m in the middle of completing my Ph.D. studying evolution using computation (game theory, ecology, intelligence) and am pursuing a certificate in college teaching. Previous experience includes BS in computer science, and a year as an instructional designer to teach teams of programmers and designers new technology and workflow. I&#8217;m interested in pedagogy, science, computers, music, and the outdoors. My more recent programming is all about combining c++ and python to reduce the barrier to entry for others to reproduce my science or use my code for other means.
