I&#8217;m a PhD student at Macquarie Uni, Australia. I&#8217;m interested in large-scale ecological and evolutionary patterns. Currently I&#8217;m applying statistical and mathematical models to understand how the metabolic theory of ecology predicts patterns of biomass and abundance at different organisation levels.
