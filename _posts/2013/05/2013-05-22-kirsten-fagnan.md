I transitioned from a postdoc to a bioinformatics and high-performance computing consultant at NERSC, part of LBNL.  I studied applied mathematics and have developed an appreciation for accurate and efficient scientific code.  I&#8217;m participating in this course because I&#8217;d like to bridge the communication gap between the computer scientists and biologists at the Joint Genome Institute.  Most of the scientists know they need computing skills, but they don&#8217;t know where to develop them or how to get help.
