I am a PhD student in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Melbourne, Australia. My research focuses on climate variability in West Antarctica, so I spend most of my time analyzing climate model data using various Python libraries (e.g. Numpy, SciPy, Climate Data Analysis Tools, Pandas, Matplotlib). In 2012, I organized a boot camp for weather/climate scientists in conjunction with the annual conference of the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society. We are planning to host another boot camp prior to next year's conference, at which I intend to teach most of the content (hence my attendance at this training course). I will also be involved in organizing a boot camp for graduate students at the University of Melbourne later this year.

In my spare time I <a href="http://drclimate.wordpress.com" title="Dr Climate" target="_blank">blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DrClimate" title="@DrClimate" target="_blank">tweet</a> about research best practice in the weather/climate sciences.
