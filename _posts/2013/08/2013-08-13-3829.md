I&#8217;m an IT consultant and software developer working for Catalyst IT (http://catalyst.net.nz) in Christchurch, New Zealand. For the past 15 years, I&#8217;ve focused on building business IT solutions, generally using the web as the medium and exclusively open source software as the tool set. As a former research scientist (developing a remote sensing tool &#8211; combining image processing and photogrammetry &#8211; for one of NZ&#8217;s &#8220;Crown Research Institutes&#8221; in the mid 90s) I have an interest in helping scientists to do even better science by making *full* use of the amazing tools they already depend on for communication, namely their computers. My education background is a BSc in Physics (Haverford College, PA, USA) and MSc in Mech Eng (U Washington, WA, USA)
