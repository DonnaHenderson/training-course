The final meeting of Round 5 will be a summary and discussion of our final teaching assignment. That meeting will form the capstone to the material we've considered in the last two and a half months.

I'm delighted with all we've covered—I've already applied these concepts in course discussions we're having in my department—but I still have very little idea how Software Carpentry *works*, its basic community processes. Topics such as:

*   How do we learn about upcoming boot camps and sign up for them?
*   How do we organize a boot camp? How do we get authorization to do it, coordinate with other bootcamps in the region, announce it and so forth?
*   How do we set up the repository for a boot camp to practice `git`?
*   How does the SWC Web site work? Can any one write a blog entry? Do they submit it in `jekyl` source, plain text, something else? What kinds of topics are appropriate? What topics are outside its scope?
*   What are SWC's two pillars … three pillars … *[Right. I'll leave and come back in.]* Amongst SWC's pillars, are such diverse elements as …?[<sup>*</sup>][1] And once we know them, how do we design a well-pillared camp?
*   What are the SWC mailing lists? What are their purposes?
*   What other initiatives are going on in the community? How might we participate?

Finally, a note. I subscribed to the *discuss* list in May. I found it incomprehensible because the discussions (at least the ones recently) required so much specific knowledge, far beyond the basics. And the few times I tried to act, I spent so much time installing and learning tools that I never got to actually do any work.

I think a better process for introducing volunteers would be for a senior person to assign the newcomer something that is useful, small, not being done by anyone else, and not time-critical. Then the volunteer can learn just enough to do that first thing, with no concern that the effort will be wasted when a more experienced member breezes through and handles it in an idle 15 minutes.

Are any of the other Round 5 participants wondering about these topics? I posted this on the blog so that others can respond.
