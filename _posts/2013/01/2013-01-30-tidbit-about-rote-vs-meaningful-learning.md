I&#8217;m working on my concept map and I stumbled on this (very long) [paper on the theory underlying concept maps and how to construct them][1]. I was struck by a paragraph about the difference between rote learning and meaningful learning, and how depth of learning is often conflated with the way of the material is taught:

> People often confuse rote learning and meaningful learning with teaching approaches that can vary on a continuum from direct presentation of information (which may be conceptually obscure or conceptually explicit) to autonomous discovery approaches where the learner perceives the regularities and constructs her/his own concepts. Both direct presentation and discovery teaching methods can lead to highly rote or highly meaningful learning by the learner, depending on the disposition of the learner and the organization of the instructional materials. &#8230; There is the mistaken notion that “inquiry” studies will assure meaningful learning. The reality is that unless students possess at least a rudimentary conceptual understanding of the phenomenon they are investigating, the activity may lead to little or no gain in their relevant knowledge and may be little more than busy work.

I think this is particularly interesting to me because I was making this very mistake; assuming that because something is presented in a novel or interactive way, more or better learning will take place.

Maybe not so relevant to the rest of you, but I hope someone finds it interesting. Now back to work!
