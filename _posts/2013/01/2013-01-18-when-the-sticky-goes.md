The great thing about the web is that you come across really good ideas and can implement them in your own teaching practice. The great thing about open source is that you can pick up the germ of an idea and make it better (maybe!)

The idea of using post-it notes with different colours to signal help/ready etc. is great but there are problems. The back of a monitor is not always visible to the instructor, and post-it notes do lose their sticky and fall off.

With a penchant for creating physical tools it didn&#8217;t take long to come up with a slightly more robust idea that also acts as an icebreaker at the start of a session. The monitor flags, three to an A4 sheet, provide an indicator that can be placed in a suitably visible position, higher up on the monitor than a post-it note and, more importantly, don&#8217;t lose their sticky, fall off and get mixed up with the course notes.

At the start of the session students are given the four necesary items &#8211; a green flag, a red flag, a stand and a paper fastener. As they assemble this they are instructed in how to use it. A small piece of blu-tac or similar can help keep it in place on top of the monitor.

They can also be branded, and  you can get students to write their name on them to let you have half a chance of being personal.<figure style="width: 800px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Enjoy! The students like them and we find them useful. They can also, if branded, act as a memento for the course.

Edit: Dealing with the colourblind. You can do an internal fold on the green flag to make it a different shape. Great idea from  Emily McTavish.<figure style="width: 383px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">
