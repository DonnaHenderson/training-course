I chose a task that came up at work today.  I was asked to combine and compare various lists of fruit fly lines that we have either already used in experiments (&#8220;pilot&#8221;) or plan to use in the future (&#8220;total&#8221;).  For others in the group, this would mean putting something together in MATLAB.  I knew that I could do it more quickly at the linux console using cat, sort, uniq, and comm.  I tried to explain it as I would to someone else in the group.
