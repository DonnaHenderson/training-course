I originally said that I would do a video on XML debugging ([teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/28/screencast-xml-debugging][1]), however the motivating example that I was going to use I was not able to find/remember properly, it was something I did some years ago. So I chose something from my day to day work which is not so much scientific as more business oriented but I hope it illustrates how Vim can help with formatting data on the fly; this which can be useful exploratory work (e.g. making outputs of data from one tool work as inputs into another tool).

The video is at: [vimeo.com/70860893][2] or you can [download it][3].

It took three takes and I think the second take was more professional in terms of speaking with fewer erm&#8217;s, it did take longer than I thought; for the 3-4 minutes of video it took about a few hours in total of thinking, planning, reading, researching what to do it on, blind alleys and building oneself up to it &#8211; so in some ways it&#8217;s embarrassing that I only have this short video to show for that and I feel like re-recording it &#8211; but I know we were told not to shine it too much.

Thanks
