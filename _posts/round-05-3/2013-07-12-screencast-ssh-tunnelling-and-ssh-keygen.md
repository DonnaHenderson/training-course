This screencast shows the steps to create a ssh tunnel in the very common situation where to get to your work computer from the outside world you have to pass first through a server.Â  Also, and this probably made it quite more long than asked (9.5 minutes), I&#8217;ve explained the generation of a public key so the connections happening on the session used a single authentication (through a passphrase).

Enjoy!
