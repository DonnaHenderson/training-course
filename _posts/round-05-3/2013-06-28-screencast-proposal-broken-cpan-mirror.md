I want to address a pretty common problem when using the interactive cpan shell to install perl modules. If the mirrors that were selected when cpan was configured go down, cpan does not deliver a very helpful error message, and it takes some digging (or prior experience) to know that you have to reset or replace a mirror. I think this might be explainable in three minutes.

UPDATE: Here is the screencast, at under three minutes not the suavest or most comprehensive tutorial, but hopefully sufficient.
