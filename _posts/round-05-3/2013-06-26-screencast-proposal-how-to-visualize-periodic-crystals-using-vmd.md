This is a task that took me a while to figure out that it was possible (the main hurdle) and then how to do it.  [VMD][1] is a molecular visualization software package.

Basically, I&#8217;ll need to demonstrate how to load your data, how to input the periodic constraints, how to set periodic boundary conditions, and how to execute a high-quality render of the result.
