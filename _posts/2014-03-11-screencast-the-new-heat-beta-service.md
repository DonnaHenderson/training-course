*In this exercise I thought that I could kill two birds with one stone &#8211; I could create a screencast for this course, and also use it internally at work to show off a new service that we are implementing&#8230;*

**Provisioning a cloud instance with Heat**

Heat is a new beta service that provisions your applications in the cloud from instructions contained in a simple text template.

You navigate to the Heat page, upload a template for your chosen application, then provide the values for any parameters required by the template. Once you&#8217;ve done this Heat will create and provision the resources required by the application within a matter of minutes.

The Heat service can make getting an application up and running on the cloud an almost a click and go experience!

The screencast below demonstrates a walk through of the process outlined above, and along the way fills in some extra information about the beta Heat service
