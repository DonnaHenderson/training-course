Hi, everyone, I&#8217;m a new assistant professor at the University of Tennessee Institute of Ag, specializing in bioinformatics.  I mainly work on developing genomic resources (genome and transcriptome sequences) for hardwood trees (chestnut, oak, walnut), but I like working on anything in the agricultural field that needs data analysis.  I want to learn to be a better teacher, especially since my students usually have very little computational background, and I want to get them excited about linux, R and python.
