Hi there! I am a 3rd year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at UBC. My research interest is robust statistics. Robust estimation and inference in a regression setting under a new contamination model (random perturbation in the data) is my current research. Regarding teaching, I have supported teaching in many undergraduate courses, particularly in introductory statistics. This involves assisting in in-class activities and providing technical support in WeBWorKiR, an on-line learning and assessment tool. I am also interested in teaching statistical programming to senior undergraduates and this brought me here. I am looking forward to the next group meeting!
