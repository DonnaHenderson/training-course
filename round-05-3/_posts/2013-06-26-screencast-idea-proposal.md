My short 3 minute screencast is going to show students how to:

*   Make a web API request in Python
*   Decode JSON that is returned from the request
*   Turn data into simple CSV that could then be exported into Excel, Google Spreadsheet, etc.

I plan to use a short script that will query the Nike+ developer API ([https://developer.nike.com/][1]) and turn a users Nike+ fitness data into CSV.

My main concern is I might really only have time for the first two bullet points.  However, I think turning data into CSV is something that is very easy and common in the scientific field.  Therefore, it seems worthwhile to try to fit it in.

Thoughts?
