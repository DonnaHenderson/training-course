I&#8217;m making a new post for my screencast video.  I posted a lengthy comment on my original post, [http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/26/screencast-idea-proposal/][1],  but I wasn&#8217;t sure if anyone would see it since the home page listing is ordered by original post date, not comment date.

So without further ado, my first youtube video and screencast: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0dwPtiu7c" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0dwPtiu7c</a>
