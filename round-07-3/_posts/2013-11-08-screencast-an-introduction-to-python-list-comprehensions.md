This screencast covers the basics of list comprehensions in Python.  (Sorry about the poor quality &#8211; couldn&#8217;t get it any better &#8211;  and my ageing MacBook&#8217;s fan whirring in the background.  Camtasia was giving it a hard time.) This is the first one of these I&#8217;ve done, so all feedback is much appreciated!



(Apologies that is is a little late, too; I was ill last week and didn&#8217;t want half the audio to be me coughing!)
