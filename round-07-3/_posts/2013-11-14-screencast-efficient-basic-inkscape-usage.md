Inkscape is a great, crossplatform, open source tool to draw vector graphics (schemas, etc).

I covered only basics of using Inkscape efficiently. I could not really show how you can prepare your SVG file in order make it ready for animations in a presentation, see <a title="an example" href="http://home.heeere.com/data/deck-js-demo-2/samples/deck-svg.html#slide-8" target="_blank">an example</a> (use right arrow to go through it).

UPDATE: here is the video, I hope it is understandable despite my English and my accent.
