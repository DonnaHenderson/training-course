I&#8217;m going to make a short screencast on how to make a simple web app built on a dygraphs chart.  Content will be deploying the dygraphs chart, and making it interact with another page element to do something simple.

Edit: the original scope was way too much for 3 minutes, so all we had time for was some live coding to get a couple of data points plotted.

Apologies for the illegible text, I tried exporting at the highest quality and it was still crap; Camtasia gets a big 0/10 from me for this.  I would expect a screencap tool to capture the screen at full resolution, if there&#8217;s no way to improve this then it&#8217;s not suitable for code tutorials.
