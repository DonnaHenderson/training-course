Context: I&#8217;m assuming that students have basic familiarity with Python/numpy arrays. Plan is to show how to plot data in multiple subplots, and how to manipulate some plot properties.

Here is version 1 which was quicker-and-dirtier than I would have liked. <http://youtu.be/i9sKJCCX3fM>

Here is version 2: <a href="http://youtu.be/mSsrsm7ybkY" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/mSsrsm7ybkY</a>

I made some changes to get it below 3 minutes and to address some of the helpful comments. (Thanks folks). My guess that it would take about an hour to redo it was pretty close. I think that having more familiarity with Camtasia would probably let me speed the process up further.
