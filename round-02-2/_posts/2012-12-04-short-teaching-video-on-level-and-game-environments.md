I recently recorded myself delivering a short presentation and tutorial session about video game level design. The presentation was given at a session hosted by the ULCS (University of Lincoln Computing Society), who invited me as a guest speaker as part of their sessions on game development.

The talk lasted for thirty minutes, which is quite a lot more than what was expected us to record, but I did intend to record and share it anyway&#8230;

There you go:



Self critique:

&#8211; I noticed that I do repeat myself  
&#8211; My text was not prepared enough, some slides could be more into detail  
&#8211; Perhaps student engagement was too forced.  
&#8211; I don&#8217;t sound too loud on the video, I&#8217;m not sure if i was loud enough during the presentation
