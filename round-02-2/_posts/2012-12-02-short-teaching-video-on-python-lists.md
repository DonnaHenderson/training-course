Here I am teaching Python Lists to the husband, roomate, and dogs. We couldn&#8217;t figure out a good way to do this at home so went with a screen shot with my voice so apologies that you can&#8217;t see me actually teaching. 

Here&#8217;s the link for the youtube video:



Self evaluation:  
&#8211; I felt totally nervous doing this and it comes off in the content and language within the video  
&#8211; I think I use the screen/terminal as a crutch. If I take a breadth and look up and talk to the audience while introducing concepts, I think the transitions would be smoother and I could be more personable.  
&#8211; I felt while teaching that the concepts were too simple but this video really demonstrates to me how much the listener has to take in over 3 minutes.
