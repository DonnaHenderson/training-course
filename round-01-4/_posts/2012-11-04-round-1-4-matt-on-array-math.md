I chose array math as my topic since I&#8217;ll be [teaching NumPy to web programmers][1] this weekend.

Notebook: [view][2] &#8211; [raw][3]

My thoughts on the teaching questions:

1.  I prefer to do live coding when working in front of a class so I would print this out and use it as lecture notes, but the class would see me working in an empty notebook.
2.  On their own learners can step through this, read my annotations, and change things to see what happens.
3.  Having a small amount of code followed by the result of that code makes it easy to see the result of changes, as shown in Bret Victor&#8217;s demo. Thinking of the book, I think demonstrating situations that work *and* situations that error helps reinforce underlying mechanics for students.
