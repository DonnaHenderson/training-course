I spent around 8 hours doing this&#8230;but it looks like I spent 1 hour!  Things took longer because I was using sqlite3 for the first time.  I was actually using SQL for the first time as well&#8230;so comments from experienced people are welcome.  I&#8217;m also pretty much a novice with GitHub and had to wrestle with some issues there.  I used the [cmap software][1]&#8230;the install takes a while but it&#8217;s easy to use.

The &#8220;why should scientists care&#8221; and code is in the notebook.  The notebook and cmap are both [here][2].
