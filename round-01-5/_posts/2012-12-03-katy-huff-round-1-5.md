I didn&#8217;t have time to create a new video, but Justin had the kind forethought to tape me teaching this bit of the shell in the UCB workshop. First, I cover &#8220;man&#8221; and &#8220;apropos&#8221;. This is part of my general philosophy that folks are better served by learning how to find help than by learning how to do specific things. Next, I cover &#8220;ls&#8221; and &#8220;cd&#8221; and generally paths on the command line.

It&#8217;s incredibly strange to watch oneself on tape. I&#8217;d say that in general I&#8217;m surprised at how much I move my hands, but that I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a terrible thing. The actual terrible thing is probably the amount of time I spend looking at and talking to the screen behind me. I also never ask the students if they have any questions.

The exercise portion of this wasn&#8217;t recorded, but you can tell that, during this section, folks are expected to be typing along.
