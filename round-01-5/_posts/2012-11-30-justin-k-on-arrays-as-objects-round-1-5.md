Here&#8217;s a short clip (from the UCB workshop) where I discussed the idea of a numpy array being an object and showed some important attributes.

The audio quality isn&#8217;t great, and I hope that my voice was easier to understand in person than on this tape. Looking at this clip now, I would also say that I probably spoke a bit too fast.

I don&#8217;t have a recording of the part where I present the exercise associated with this lesson, but the relevant part was related to array methods and references/pointers &#8211; &#8220;Figure out how to make B an independent copy of A, so that when we change a value in B, A will stay the same. Hint: Look at the methods of A.&#8221;
