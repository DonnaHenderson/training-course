My original background is in physics, and after working for a number of years as a client project engineer in the software industry, I returned to science and am currently a full-time PhD student in geophysics/remote sensing at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. My main tools used to be SQL, HTML / CSS / JavaScript, and are now Matlab, R, NCL, plus Python, which has been a constant companion for many years.
