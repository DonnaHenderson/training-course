I work at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics (Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) as Research Technologies Group Lead <<a title="http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/personal/eschnetter/" href="http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/personal/eschnetter/" target="_blank">http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/personal/eschnetter/</a>>. My research interests lie in computational science, in using computers as tools to solve scientific and engineering problems. I am active in several open-source projects (e.g. the <a title="Einstein Toolkit" href="http://einsteintoolkit.org" target="_blank">Einstein Toolkit</a>).

I frequently collaborate or interact with people who have little programming knowledge and/or are unfamiliar with numerical methods. I hope to learn in this course some methods or approaches that would help me help them.
