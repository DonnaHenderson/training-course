I&#8217;m a Postdoc atÂ Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada, where I synthesize data from a pollination biology research network. I am an open science and open access advocate, and co-founded rOpenSci, a developer collective to make open source packages in R to facilitate reproducible science.
