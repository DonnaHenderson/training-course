These questions are for Jeremiah&#8217;s concept [map on Python dictionaries][1].

**Question 1**

Suppose you have a Python dictionary that&#8217;s defined as follows:

`test_dictionary = {<br />
    'who': 'first',<br />
    'what': 'second',<br />
    'i_dont_know': 'third',<br />
}`

You want to access the value of &#8220;`i_dont_know`&#8220;. Which of the following would work to access the value? Select all that apply.

**A.** `test_dictionary[i_dont_know]`  
**B.** `test_dictionary['i_dont_know']`  
**C.** `test_dictionary[3]`  
**D.** `test_dictionary[-1]`  
**E.** `test_dictionary.'i_dont_know'`

**Question 2**

Launch Python, and define `test_dictionary` as above. Then add several more key / value pairs to it. Type `test_dictionary.` (with the dot at the end) and press the tab key twice. You&#8217;ll see a list of all of the things you can do with `test_dictionary`. Use one of those operations to print just the values (without their keys) from the dictionary. Then do `print test_dictionary` and `print [the code you came up with to show just the values]` and show the results.
