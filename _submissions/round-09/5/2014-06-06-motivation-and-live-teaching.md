We got together to discuss our motivational screencast exercise this past Wednesday, and to be honest, the results weren't as strong as they had been for previous exercises. Quite a few videos came in late, many were over time, and most importantly, the majority explained *how* to do something, rather than convincing viewers that the topic was worth learning.

The discussion of demotivation and what to do about it went better: many people found common threads in the stories other participants had shared. The two that I drew out were unfairness and indifference, and we discussed some things instructors can do to address these.

For our next exercise, we will take another run at motivating learners, and also get some practice both teaching live, and giving and receiving critiques of live teaching. When we meet again on June 18, everyone will have 90 seconds—really 90 seconds, not 95 seconds or two minutes—to do a live presentation via Google Hangout to the rest of the group in order to convince them that something is worth learning. You can point the camera at yourself or share your screen; you can draw on the whiteboard, show slides, code live, or recite poetry, but whatever you do, your goal is to make us *want* to learn something (which must be related to the things we teach in our bootcamps).

To get ready for this, you will practice your presentations in pairs during the coming two weeks. I've tried to respect time zones in the match-up below (Aur, I took you seriously when you said you were a "night person"), and I'll mail out introductions as well so that you have each other's contact information. I look forward to seeing you all in two weeks.

**Software Carpentry Instructor Training** Group 9 / June 4, 2014

Most scientists don't want to learn how to code. They regard it as a tax they have to pay in order to do their science. If they wanted to be computer scientists, they could have chosen a different major as undergrads.

Unfairness is demotivating. This includes feeling that the teacher's attention is unfairly divided, e.g. devoted more to those asking questions than those who are too behind to ask.

Feeling that nobody cares about you is demotivating.

If you get asked a question that it's uneconomic to answer during class, a good idea is to publicly commit *in writing* to answer it later.

In a course Greg attended, they had a game mechanism for making everyone talk at least a third as much as the most talkative person (all get three tokens, you use them by asking questions, when everyone used at least once you all of them three back)

*   This works well in small (8-person) meetings, too.

Greg also knew someone who created a person-by-person matrix (with each person's name intersecting every other person in the class). Whenever someone interrupted someone else, the meeting head would put a tick mark at the intersection of those two people, quantifying who's interrupting whom, and how often. (This was a specific troubleshooting method for a spefic problem they had, and should be taken as example, not technique.)

**19:00 Eastern (16:00 Pacific)**

*   Jeremiah Lant (Louisville, Kentucky, USA): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/05/28/motivational-screencast-on-plotting-in-python/> (eastern) 
    *   Greg: 18 seconds over! good on "why I'd care" --- you could have stopped before the sine wave demo (which goes from "why I care" to "how to use it")
*   Chandler Wilkerson (Rice University, TX): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/05/29/motivational-learn-vi-macros-and-substitutions/> 
    *   Greg: OK, I believe there are some useful features, but why would I use a plain text editor at all? Especially one with such cryptic syntax for things like search and replace?
*   Scott Burns (Vanderbilt University, TN): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/05/29/motivation-for-github/> (central) 
    *   Greg: 35 seconds over! And there's too much on the screen... The "here's a feature, here's why you care" approach is good.
*   Matthew Dimmock <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/05/30/motivational-screencast-on-medical-imaging/> 
    *   Greg: In what I saw, there wasn't any motivation given for learning this, only technical details on how it works. I don't have a better answer for "why would I want to know how an MRI scanner works" now than I did before.
    *   6:30 instead of 3:00! And I agree with Aur --- this is how it works, not why I'd want to learn it.
    *   AEST
*   Dan Warren (Macquarie University, Sydney Australia): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/06/04/motivation-for-learning-to-write-functions-in-r/> 
    *   Australian Eastern time zone
*   Yu-Ching Shih (National Taiwan University, Taipei Taiwan): no URL. 
    *   EST
*   Simon Michnowicz (*Monash) 
    *   Greg: good at motivating --- "there \*is\* a better way"
    *   <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/05/22/motivational-video-for-regular-expressions/>
    *   Melbourne. Australia.0
    *   (EST)
    *   **Time zone:** EST (Eastern Standard Time)**Current time zone offset:** +10:00 hours
*   Aur Saraf (Tel Aviv, Israel): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/05/31/motivation-for-learning-for-loops-in-python/> 
    *   8 seconds over! and will nested loops motivate for loops, or confuse people?
    *   ISR (GMT+2), but I'm a night person
*   Jacob Levernier (U. Oregon, USA): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/05/29/motivational-screencast-on-bash/> 
    *   PST / UTC --- 8 hours
    *   Greg: elevator music?? <img src="http://localhost:8080/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> and 6:41 instead of 3:00 --- tsk tsk. But I did like the example...
*   Tim McNamara (NeSI, New Zealand) 
    *   <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/?p=7484>
    *   NZST (UTC +12h, I believe)
    *   Greg: 1:50 over! awful sound (but you knew that); getting lost in setting headers etc. at the start really takes the wind out of it; no motivational story

Common threads in demotivational stories

*   students not feeling important or valued
*   No perceived value in the course work
*   People wanting to learn and do good work and getting caught up with obstacles that weren't really related to the learning part of what they were doing (prof.s having unreasonable expectations, bureaucracy, etc.)
*   Poor teacher experience 
    *   "I think the situation would have been a lot better if the teacher had provided more background"
    *   "He brushed it off..."
*   Teachers not motivating.
*   bad experience in course, feeling humiliated or embarrassed

**14:00 Eastern (11:00 Pacific)**

*   Dav Clark --- PST (UC Berkeley, USA): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/06/02/motivation-for-learning-the-javascript-debugger-in-chrome/> 
    *   Greg: 4:32 instead of 3:00! good demo of the debugger, but not nearly enough on why I'd use it.
*   Bror Jonsson (Princeton University, back to EDT!) <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/06/03/screen-cast-of-how-to-download-file-in-python/> 
    *   Greg: no motivation story; nice example of how easy it is to download and plot data files (good start to an intro Python lesson)
*   Padraic Stack (Dublin GMT): video link? <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/06/04/motivation-and-demotivation-3/>
*   Michael Schliephake (KTH, Stockholm) CEST : <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/05/31/motivation-for-shell-and-shellprogramming/> 
    *   Greg: no demotivation; please post video on a sharing site; nice recap of how the shell acquired features; took a while to get to "save commands in a file for re-use", but once there, good motivation.
*   Catalina Anghel (Toronto, ON, Eastern, I think): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/06/03/motivation-for-learning-r-clustering-of-our-class/> 
    *   Greg: 12 seconds over! but a nice example that will resonate with people: a few lines of code, some useful insight
*   Jonathan Frederic (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, CA, USA), PST: <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/05/31/motivation-for-ipython/> 
    *   Greg: no demotivation (it's there now); 28 seconds over! Opening with "here's how you do it in Word" could have been the whole motivation --- "look how painful this is, now watch me do the same thing in the notebook" --- things like "it shows all the folders" aren't going to convince people
*   Isabel Fenton (Imperial College, London), GMT: <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/06/04/motivation-for-learning-functions/>
*   Genevieve Smith (UT Austin), CST: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxVLGZo7hLE> 
    *   Greg: 1 second over! (you're killing me here) --- do you think your graphs will motivate people or scare them? (They did both for me)

Common threads in demotivation

*   lack of feedback
*   A mismatch between teacher and participant expectations resp. prerequisites seems for me to be the main reason of demotivation.
*   some bad faith
*   Wrong level of difficulty
*   dry presentation
*   teachers making assumptions (knowledge of students, background)
*   Lack of information (misunderstanding of the topic)

Unfairness: lots of groups with previous experiences of unfair treatment Any reinforcement of that unfairness will demotivate students Greg mentioned 50/50 split almost always accepted, 60/40 split is almost always (~90%) rejected.

Greg will post numbers on female representation in comp sci, etc.

Students who don't ask questions: most likely to need more help, probably avoiding asking We should be seeking them out in our bootcamps

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs:

*   Maslow theorized without data (i.e., he made it up)
*   It's wrong. Feeling that one matters is hugely important to people, at a base level.
*   Our school systems tend to be very bad at accommodating needs.

Indifference: Best way to make students think we care: to actually care

Offer tangible proof that you will get back to a student/return to their problem --- an email, a post-it note Learn names of students

Notes: Practice your 90 second pitch with your partner, Greg will pair us up according to timezones Let him know if there's anyone in particular you'd like to be paired up with Greg will announce pairings on Friday

*   you will meet another instructor! which is good for our community
*   you won't be going into your pitch cold in two weeks
*   Can change topics from your video, but still needs to be something related to software carpentry, something we would teach in a bootcamp

Everyone gets nervous when teaching/presenting

**10:00 Eastern (7:00 Pacific)**

*   Alexandra Simperler (Imperial College London, UK):<http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/05/28/7355/> 
    *   Greg: please post video to a sharing site, and please talk about *external* demotivators
    *   London
*   Mark Stillwell (Cranfield University, UK): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/06/02/motivation-video-for-vagrant/> 
    *   Greg: no demotivational story; video doesn't show up on FF, doesn't play in Chrome, on Mac OS X 10.8
    *   London / GMT / UTC
*   Tim Warren (University Washington, Seattle) <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/05/26/screencast-on-python-dictionary/> 
    *   Greg: 4 seconds over! horrible audio quality --- showing me how to use it, not \*why\*
    *   PDT
*   Hsingtzu Wu (JAEA) <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/05/28/motivation-video-and-demotivating-experience/> 
    *   Greg: I don't think the "add up numbers" example will be compelling, but your discussion around it (esp. "change one value, change the bounds on the loop, make fewer mistakes") is good
    *   Japan(JST)
*   Florian Rathgeber (Imperial College London, UK), BST (Europe/London): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/05/28/motivational-screencast-the-power-of-list-comprehensions/> 
    *   Greg: squares of integers isn't necessarily compelling (why would I want to do that?) Also, do you really need to talk about list append to motivate for loops? Ditto "zero up to but not including"
*   Dan MacLean (The Sainsbury Lab, Norwich, UK): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/05/29/motivational-video-for-regular-expressions-2/#comments> 
    *   Greg: no demotivational story; video is good
    *   in BST (GMT + 1), London
*   Christian Jacobs (Imperial College London, UK) (BST/London): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/05/21/motivation-python-dictionaries/> 
    *   Greg: showing me how to use them, but not really inspiring me to want to
*   Jeff Hollister (US EPA, Rhode Island, USA, Eastern Daylight) <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/05/30/motivational-screencast-for-data-structures-in-r/> 
    *   Greg: 42 seconds over! but otherwise good
*   Graham Etherington (BST) (The Sainsbury Lab, Norwich) <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/06/03/motivation-video-perl-grep/> 
    *   Greg: 1:13 over! again, showing me how to use it, not why I'd care
*   Russell Alleen-Willems (Diachronic Design, Seattle, WA)(Pacific Daylight Time, UTC -7 hours) <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/05/28/screencast-on-why-programming-loops-are-cool/> 
    *   Greg: good example, good visuals, well motivated
*   Shyam Rallapalli (The Sainsbury Laboratory, Norwich): [Sorry no video from me] 
    *   GMT + 1 (London)
*   Mark Wilber (UC, Santa Barbara) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0kp6HWC2x0&feature=youtu.be> Pacific Time Zone 
    *   Greg: nothing demotivating? programming concepts in video are probably too advanced for people who don't yet know why they should use functions, but the motivation itself is well done

**What common threads did you see in other people's demotivational stories?**

*   Changing goal posts: instructors changed aspects of the assignment midway or after some students had completed the assignment
*   Injustice
*   People got hurt in some psychologial way
*   they did not get a deserved reward
*   The student did not think they were valued in the class
*   expectation to do follow the mechanics without deeper explanations. Inflexibility.
*   No a priori belief they could do it, for whatever reason, not helped.
*   Perceived disengagement on part of instructor
*   inefficiency 
    *   The truest form of respect is to treat other people as if their time was as valuable as yours.
*   Poor ability of instructors to motivate ideas, concepts or requirements

Motivating --- selling the idea! Especially to people who don't need to care.

Two weeks from now, 90secs live, to convince Greg that the idea is worth learning. Will share over Google Hangouts, can share video/screen, but don't have to. The idea should be related to the things SC is interested in. Need not keep to same topic.

Don't go in cold. In the next two weeks, do a rehearsal with another person. Then do it online with someone else in this teaching group

Unfairness demotivates like almost nothing else can. People would rather go without than settle for less than they deserve.

People will go to extreme lengths to feel that they are important. Given a choice between self respect and food, people will choose self-respect. If in a classroom , therefore, people feel the instructor is being unfair they will become de-motivated. One reason why class/instructor ratio (40/2) is high. Why instructor must talk to the student.

Thorny problems that need call back can be IOU'd with sticky notes, to provide a commitment to action and proof that they matter as a student.

People will behave differently if they consider themselves anonymous than if they are known, they are more involved.
