Hi! I work as the Data Scientist at the UC Berkeley Social Sciences Data-Lab, or [D-Lab][1] for short. I'm also chief scientist at [Oroeco][2], where I mostly do user analytics. I do a lot of teaching (mostly Python) and infrastructure at the D-Lab, and am very interested in applying open science to problems surrounding climate, energy, wellness (I'm also a Feldenkrais teacher), and behavior.
