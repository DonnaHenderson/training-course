I am training Computational Chemistry Software to all UK academics who are interested in CPD. I work for the NSCCS (www.nsccs.ac.uk) for almost 3 years now. Before I used to work for a major software producer as trainer. I am looking forward to run SCs for my users to demonstrate them that the command line is not that evil and scripting languages are quite nifty.
