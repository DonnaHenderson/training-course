I am a Research Ecologist with the US Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s Office of Research and Development where I study the links between landscape structure and water quality. Currently, I spend my days trying to model cyanobacteria in lakes. Â Also as a part of my job I develop tools, mostly in R, to help make our research more open and reproducible and teach others how to do the same.
