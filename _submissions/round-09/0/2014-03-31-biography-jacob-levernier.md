I am a doctoral student in Psychology at the University of Oregon, and am passionate about data science, where Psychology, Data Analysis / Statistics, and Computer Science meet. My research interests include moral development and data literacy. In line with these interests, I'm also involved with efforts to increase data management literacy through the Science Library at the U. of Oregon.
