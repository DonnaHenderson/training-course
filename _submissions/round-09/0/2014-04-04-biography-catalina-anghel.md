Hello!  I&#8217;m a postdoctoral researcher at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, studying tumour heterogeneity.  My background is in more pure math, so I&#8217;m really excited to learn more about computational tools that I never new about (version control,  free software for scientific calculations like R and Python), and hope to teach others about them  (especially involving the math department or teaching high school students).
