I am a Post Doctoral Researcher at the National Taiwan University (NTU), where I recently finished my PhD. My background is Computational Mechanics and I&#8217;ve been using Python as my research tool for 5 years. I&#8217;m interested in helping to train students and researchers to code and to be more productive.
