My name is Padraic Stack, I'm a 'Digital Humanities Support Officer' in NUI Maynooth, Ireland. It's a role based in part in the university library and I think librarians could use command line tools to make repetitive tasks easier, and more difficult tasks possible. I am looking to learn more about using these tools and how to encourage others to use them.
