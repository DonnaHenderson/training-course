I am a Hydrologist for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) at the Kentucky Water Science Center in Louisville, Kentucky.  I have been working for the USGS for approximately three years, and my work mainly includes hydrodynamic and hydrologic modeling.  I have a B.S. in Physics from the University of Kentucky and a M.S. in Geodetic Science from the Ohio State University.  Between undergraduate and graduate school, I taught high school physics in Atlanta, Georgia through a program called Teach For America.  My interests include rock climbing, traveling, and programming.
