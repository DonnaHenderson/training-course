My team administers high-performance computing clusters for Rice University. My days are split between public facing (answering user questions, arranging workshops, editing our website) and enterprise facing (care and feeding of clusters, license management, third level Linux OS support for our IT organization) tasks. I believe there is a strong need at our university, especially in the graduate program, for less academic, more nuts and bolts coursework of the type offered by Software Carpentry.
