  I am an archaeologist working through my consulting and training company, Diachronic Design. There I consult on digital infrastructure for archaeology projects, create tutorials on using software packages like databases and GIS, provide one-on-one help via video conference tools, and write blog posts about data collector software and ideas and news about digital archaeology. I believe that archaeologists, like many scientists, could use technology more effectively to improve the way we collect, analyze, publish, and archive data and interpretations and am very excited by the work Software Carpentry is doing to improve technological literacy among scientists.
