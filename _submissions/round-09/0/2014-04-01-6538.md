I'm currently a graduate student based atÂ Singapore Centre on Environmental Life Sciences Engineering (SCELSE), a research institute shared between NTU and NUS Singapore. My current project revolves the genomic and transcriptomic analyses of metagenomic samples.

Research interests include data visualisation, graph theory and parallel computing. Picked up most of my bioinformatics skills on my own hoping to be add onto my toolbox whatever I can get my hands on. Currently a TA for a undergraduate Bioinformatics course in NUS hoping to be more proficient in teaching.
