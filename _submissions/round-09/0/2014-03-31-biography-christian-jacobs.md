I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Applied Modelling and Computation Group at Imperial College London. My research is in the field of computational fluid dynamics, and currently focusses on multiphase flow modelling and the automated solution of partial differential equations. In addition to research, I thoroughly enjoy teaching and open-source software development, particularly with the use of the Python programming language.
