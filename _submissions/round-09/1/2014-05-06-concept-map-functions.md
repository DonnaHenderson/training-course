Hi all, here's a go at a concept map for "functions". My motivation was something I read a few times in the Julia documentation, "write functions, not scripts!". The authors clearly had the impression that scientists and researchers don't rate function decomposition very highly!

I was surprised at how much easier it was to explain *why* functions were useful, rather than simply *what* they were.

**EDIT:** updated after feedback from Mark Wilber.

Now we're really starting to look like spaghetti. Even though it's messy, I think it's important to inter-relate concepts. There could probably be many more arrows drawn across the page.
