This should run it on a browser.I did have good experience with CamStudio in the past. So I relied on it &#8230; bad idea.

The only de-motivator in my life so far is myself.

I don&#8217;t do things because I am too lazy, I can&#8217;t be asked or I don&#8217;t like doing them.

If I am in situations described by Greg and others on the forum (and I have been) I usually &#8220;fight&#8221; back. In my 42 years of living I never quite got why a human being shall keep me away from something or ruin something from me. This means an analysis of the situation Is it me? Is it them? If its them &#8211;> keep going. I have been told my written English is terrible and I shall go back to Germany (I am Austrian!) and publish in German. I got a third person on board and got some linguistic tips, rewrote the paper by myself and then got told, oh good that person 3 wrote it for you. The forum is too fragile to be exposed to what I thought at that moment. So the learning outcome was: yes, I can write papers &#8211; however I need someone to check that no Anglo-Saxon feelings are hurt. But no need to stop writing all together. No need to apply for the Pulitzer Prize either <img src="http://localhost:8080/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />

De-motivation should be certainly replaced with an assertive reality check. Sometimes when we teach we can come across somebody &#8220;who doesn&#8217;t get it&#8221;. So shall we tell them not to do it? Or de-motivate them? It can be often enough to get them to a certain level.

But make them aware what this level is, and offer tools how to overcome it.

External Demotivators: for me often when people don&#8217;t care &#8211; why should I??
