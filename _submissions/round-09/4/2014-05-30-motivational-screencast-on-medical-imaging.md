**An introduction to how medical imaging works.**



**Demotivating Experience**

When I was at school I had a "Science teacher" who when I asked why clothes were the colour they were, answered me with "because they just are".  This was not the only question I asked where I got this answer.

Being 12 years old and very inquisitive, I found these answers extremely frustrating and as my parents knew nothing about Science, they couldn't help either.  Hitting this brick wall was extremely frustrating and put me off Science in school.

What I wished the teacher had said was "well I don't actually know but what you need to look for in the library is a simple book on chemistry and chemical bonds".
