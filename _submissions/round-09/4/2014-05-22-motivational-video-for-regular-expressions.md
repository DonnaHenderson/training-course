My de-motiovational Story.

When in primary school I joined the school choir for Speech Day. After much practice the frustrated teacher said &#8220;Who is singing off key? You&#8217;re putting everyone off.&#8221; She made us all sing a note and then listened to us all one by one till she found me. I was ordered to do a &#8220;Milli Vinilli&#8221; and mime the words. After one song she said &#8220;Much Better&#8221;. I never tried to sing in public again.Â  Now I must admit that my attempts on the Karaoke game &#8220;Singstar:&#8221; yield similar results, but I have met music teachers who assure me that humans can be taught to sing in tune, and that I was never given any training or advice other than &#8216;to practice&#8217;. Maybe I&#8217;ll find such a teacher one day and improve my Singstar score..
