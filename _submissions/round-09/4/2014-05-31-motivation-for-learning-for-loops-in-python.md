I had another example from the same game that didn&#8217;t make the cut. It involved interpreting directions the game gave you for solving a maze:



I&#8217;m not very happy with the quality, but after trying a dozen times with CamStudio and encountering different bugs after the recording was done, I just took the first run that worked (using Microsoft&#8217;s [Screnrecorder][1] utility.)

## On Demotivation

In high school, I had a recurring argument with my Civics teacher over a few falsehoods that made their way into the book we used (and were considered the only correct answers in the national test she was preparing us for, the Israeli Civics &#8220;Bagrut&#8221; or high school exit test.) In a private conversation outside class, she admitted that those parts of the material were untrue and she was teaching them because the test required it and she thought my fellow students would be confused by learning two versions &#8211; one correct, one for the test. I wouldn&#8217;t have it and so I mentioned that conversation during the next lesson. We parted ways at that.

It was a very hard case to prevent. She was right about not confusing most of the class with two versions just because I care so much about the truth in such a loaded subject. I heard her explanation and just wouldn&#8217;t have it. I was the special kind of idealistic that you can only be when you&#8217;re a teenager that only saw the real world through books. There was simply no compromise to be had. What she could have done (preferably before or during our out-of-class discussion) is propose that instead of attending the lessons I would study the classical texts on civics in the library and hand in essays to earn my grade. In the worst case, I would have failed the national test but remained with a strong appetite for civics. As it were, I acquired a strong distaste for any consensus opinion on the subject, and drifted into opinions so extreme that they became useless to talk about the real world and I lost interest.
