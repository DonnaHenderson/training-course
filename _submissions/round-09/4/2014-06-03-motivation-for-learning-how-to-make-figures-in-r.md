Here&#8217;s my screencast:[Â http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxVLGZo7hLE][1]

And here&#8217;s my story: When I was in the early stages of coursework for my phd I was taking a required survey of my field (Ecology, Evolution & Behavior). During the ecology portion we were tasked with a small project that involved doing a bit of matrix multiplication. Our instructor assumed we weren&#8217;t really smart enough to remember back to our high school/undergrad math courses, and essentially told us as much. So we were supposed to use a kind of worksheet for calculating the values we needed. When I asked if it would be alright for those of us who were comfortable doing the math to go ahead with it, and skip the worksheet, I was told no. I was insulted by the assumption and infuriated by the instructions. The end result was that I did a lot of sulking for the remainder of the semester. This could have been avoided if the instructor had had a better understanding of the class&#8217; math background, or with some flexibility in dealing with students who were prepared to move a little faster.
