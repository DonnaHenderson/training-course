I didn't introduce myself.  I figured with 3 minutes I would cut straight to the content.

## Demotivating Experience

The most recent demotivational experience I had actually wasn't related to academia, but I do think it relates to software carpentry.  I've been working on a project in my spare time for the past 4 years.  Specifically, it's a video game.  I spent the first 3 years writing the game's engine in .net code.  I used a library called Mogre (managed wrapper for the popular Ogre 3d library).  As I pushed the boundaries of Mogre, I found that I needed features which were available in Ogre but not yet wrapped in Mogre.  I decided I would set out to find an automated way to write my own managed wrapper for Ogre.  Naturally I stumbled on SWIG which seemed to be everything I ever needed.  When I started trying to use SWIG, I spent a lot of time in the user manual.  I slowly realized that SWIG wasn't what I thought it was.  After realizing that I would have to write simple interfaces by hand, I was completely demotivated.  I thought the entire purpose of SWIG was to automate, but it didn't seem like that was the case.
