I am a postdoc in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at the University of Connecticut in the US. I&#8217;m currently working on examining patterns of plant community structure in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. Other topics of research include conservation biology, invasion biology, and climate change. I generally am interested in methods development and using computational resources to make analyses better and more efficient.
