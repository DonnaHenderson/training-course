Hi, I&#8217;m Heather. I am a Research Instrument Analyst at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, where I monitor the health and stability of the WFC3 instrument. All my data analysis is done through Python and is version controlled through GIT. My programming experience began with IDL, until I switched completely to Python a little over 2 years go.Â I&#8217;ve done several version control and python training exercises with new hires at STScI and have previously participated as a student in Software Carpentry. I&#8217;m looking forward to learning the best practices for teaching programming.
