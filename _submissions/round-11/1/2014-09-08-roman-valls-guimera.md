I am a [research software engineer][1] working at [INCF][2], investigating and building infrastructure for better (neuro)scientific data sharing. Previously I taught good python practices at [Science for Life Laboratory][3] by using [python koans (git, unit tests and Travis-CI)][4].

I have a BSc in computer engineering by Barcelona Tech and a MSc in computational biology by KTH, Sweden.Â My intention is to consolidate my teaching skills and be able to effectively transfer software development best practices in any professional environment.
