I am an environmental reporting analyst for the British Columbia Ministry of Environment, where I analyze data and report to the public on a breadth of environmental topics.  I am a heavy R user, a light Python user, and use git for version control on my projects. I have taught a 2-day R course to colleagues at work, and will be teaching another this fall.

The nature of my work requires that I work with a lot of other people&#8217;s data, so I try to promote the use of open, reproducible tools and good data management practices to my colleagues.  I attended a Software Carpentry bootcamp at the University of Victoria, and was sold on their approach to teaching these tools.
