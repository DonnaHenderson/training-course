I am no stranger to Software Carpentry; rather, I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m quite the fan! While a postdoc at NESCent, I attended Bootcamp at U of North Carolina in fall 2012 and the first Data Carpentry last spring. My research focus is comparative genomics using next-generation sequencing data, but I&#8217;m broadly interested in comparative methods and novel analysis of large-scale datasets.

I am a brand-spanking new assistant professor at the University of Texas at Tyler. I&#8217;m preparing to teach bioinformatics (lecture + lab) next spring as a part of a newly developed undergrad minor in bioinformatics and genomics, and am excited to hone my skills as an instructor in this course. Moreover, I&#8217;m interested in developing modules specific to next-gen sequencing data and genomics as well as emphasizing the importance of reproducibility and data/code sharing among my students and colleagues.
