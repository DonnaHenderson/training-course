I am PhD student in geology at the University of Colorado, working on landscape connectivity and sediment transport during floods. My research relies heavily on numerical modeling and very large topographic and climatic dataset to explore the feedbacks between small-scale processes that result in measurable changes to the landscape. I primarily work with Python and Matlab (and a bit with C/C++) to write small data processing tools for myself, as well as develop components for a couple of large, collaborative models. 

I have been involved in undergraduate-level teaching for several years, as a primary instructor for field and lab-based geology courses and as a TA for a variety of others, and I recently obtained a certificate in college teaching that required some formal instruction on learning philosophies and course evaluations. I have, however, no experience teaching quantitative topics or programming, and I am very excited to finally get some training on this.
