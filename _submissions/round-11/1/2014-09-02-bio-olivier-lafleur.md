I am a teacher in the Computer Science Department at Cégep de Lévis-Lauzon. I just finished my M. Sc. in Computer Science at Université Laval, in Québec city.  
I also did my B. Sc. in Mathematics, which makes me interested in different math-related subjects : AI, computer vision, infographics and functional programming, for example.

I also worked professionnaly in web developement, so these days I'm mostly into web frameworks (Django, Laravel, etc.). Where I worked, we had a big focus on testing and clean code, so that makes me really interested in software carpentry.
