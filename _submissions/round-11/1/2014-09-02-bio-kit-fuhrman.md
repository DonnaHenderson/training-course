This summer, I graduated with a PhD in Biomedical Science from the University of Florida.  My dissertation work revolved around regulatory T cell differentiation and their role during autoimmune disease.  I also have experience in Genetics, virtual high-throughput screening and HIV research.  I've have enjoyed being a hobby coder for the last 20 years and worked for a time in my undergraduate career programming augmented reality headset.

I have just moved to Boston (Brookline area).  I'm looking to meet people, find hiking and cycling trails, and find employment.
