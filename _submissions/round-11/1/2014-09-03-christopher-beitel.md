Hey I&#8217;m Chris. This is my bio for the SWC training course. I&#8217;m a Ph.D. student at UC Davis in Jonathan Eisen&#8217;s lab. I work on metagenomics. I&#8217;m participating in Software Carpentry to supplement my graduate education with knowledge of how to teach future students and team members. Specifically how to teach them to be really good at analyzing data and writing software for doing so. That and general fangirlling for SWC and Mozilla Science Lab.

Oh and my background is in pure math, machine learning/stats, CS, and recently my Ph.D. in Genetics which has been a lot of molecular biology as well as ML.
