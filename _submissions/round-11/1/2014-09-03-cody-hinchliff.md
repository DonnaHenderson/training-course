I'm a plant systematist and evolutionary biologist currently doing postdoctoral work in software development and infrastructure for biology. As a researcher I operate at the interface of computational methodology and large scale phylogenetics. I'm interested in addressing broad evolutionary questions related to the origin and maintenance of all kind of organismal diversity. I often make use of public resources like GenBank and GBIF to provide broadly-scoped data, and I program in Python, Java, and R (and dabble in C/C++) to develop analysis pipelines and tools for use by myself and other biologists.

I have several years of experience teaching undergraduate science lab courses, and several additional years doing individualized tutoring in math and science, but no formal training in teaching. I'm looking forward to this course, where I hope to improve my understanding of teaching methodology and fill in gaps in my ability to make information accessible to students with different learning modes and capabilities.
