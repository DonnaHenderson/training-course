I am a third year Ph.D. student at the University of New Mexico studying quantum information theory. I also have a bachelors in computer engineering from the University of Arizona, where I developed much of my interest in software engineering. I have worked in the past optimizing cryptographic and linear algebra routines using CUDA, but currently Python 3 fills all of my computational needs.

Several of my colleagues and I have been working to implement better software engineering practices in our code, and are interested in hosting a bootcamp in the near future. I hope this course can provide me with some tools to more effectively communicate the importance of basic software engineering practices and make me more qualified to teach these practices in a volunteer capacity.
