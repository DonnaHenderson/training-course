I'm an evolutionary biologist interested in documenting spatio-temporal patterns of biodiversity in particular among marine organisms. I'm in the final weeks of my PhD at the University of Florida where I have been studying species diversity and species limits in sea cucumbers. I use R throughout my workflow, and maintain the phylobase package (http://github.com/fmichonneau/phylobase). I'm a proponent of reproducible research, and I want to teach my peers the basic computing skills needed to make their research more open and reproducible.
