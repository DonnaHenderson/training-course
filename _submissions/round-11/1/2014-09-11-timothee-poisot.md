I&#8217;m a computational ecologist working on species interaction networks, how they vary over time and space, and why it matters for emergent ecosystem properties. I am currently a post-doc at the University of Canterbury, and I will start a position as an assistant professor at the Universite de Montreal, this January. For my day to day research, I use C, python, julia and R, and I write papers in markdown or latex. I use Linux exclusively since 2012.
