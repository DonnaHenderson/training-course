I am a Master's student at Clemson University, South Carolina, and I'm a researcher in high performance computational fluid dynamics. I also teach programming to undergraduate and graduate students, typically in short, one-off sessions. Before Software Carpentry, I used *ad hoc* teaching methods---and materials---that were somewhat arbitrary, seemingly with some success.

Applying the principles I'm learning here is clearly improving the efficacy of my sessions --- I can see this from the feedback I receive! Also, applying *evidence-based* methods and developing teaching material accordingly allows me to be confident that I'm teaching the right things in the right way. I'm looking forward to learning more from you, and I'm ever-grateful to SWC for making me a better researcher and a better teacher
