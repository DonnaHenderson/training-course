Hi, I&#8217;m a post doc at the University of Toronto, in both the Departments of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology and Geography. I&#8217;m interested in relationships between human cultural diversity and biological diversity. I do a mix of field work in rural areas to understand why people manage landscapes and biodiversity in particular ways, and analyses of global datasets of cultural, linguistic and ecological information. I&#8217;m also generally interested in open science/transparent science.
