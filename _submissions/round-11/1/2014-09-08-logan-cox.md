Hello!

I&#8217;m a software developer at the University of Oklahoma Libraries where I work on projects centered around building archival-quality online homes for digital assets, documents, and data sets.

I&#8217;m excited about this course because I think it will help me to improve the quality of our support and training efforts for people who want to build tools that interact with the resources that we provide.
