Hi all,

I&#8217;m a research scientist in computational biology and bioinformatics at the Victorian Life Sciences Computation Initiative in Melbourne, Australia. I am also a contributor and core developer of the scikit-image Python library for image processing.

I have a wide range of interests but the top would have to be connectomics: the study of neuronal computation through its wiring diagrams.

I really enjoy teaching but I must admit that until now I&#8217;ve been winging it! I&#8217;m excited to take teacher training and become more methodical in my teaching methods!
