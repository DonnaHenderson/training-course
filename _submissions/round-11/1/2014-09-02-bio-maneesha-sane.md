My undergraduate & graduate background is in education, psychology, and linguistics.  I've been working in the fields of education & nonprofit management for the past 15 years or so, and have taught myself software programming and data management/analysis.

I split my time between mothering a toddler, working as a programmer in VBA & SQL (MS Access), and hobby projects, mainly in Python.  I'm also very interested in GIS.  I've been teaching Intro to Python workshops in Philadelphia for the past few years and was a helper at a Software Carpentry workshop this summer.

I'm really excited to combine my background in education with my experience in programming & data analysis to develop technology curricula.
