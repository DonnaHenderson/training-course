Hello, I'm Dani! I'm currently seeking employment in technical curriculum development, but my roots are in the sciences. While working in stem cell biology and tissue engineering at UCSF, I noticed there was a lacking focus on computation that caused a lot of issues in reproducibility and collaboration. This got me interested in diving deeper. It was while I was working in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UCB that I heard about Software Carpentry. I've gotten really interested in the cause and am excited to embark on this journey. <img src="http://localhost:8080/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
