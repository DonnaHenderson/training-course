I first found out about Software Carpentry from Amanda Harlin from the OKC.js community. I have a Bachelors and Masters in Chemical Engineering from the University of Oklahoma, and had a brief stint teaching an introductory chemistry lab at Oklahoma City Community College. I enjoy computers. I used to build web pages and blog when these things were still kind of new, and then spent some long years modifying a Fortran model for melt blowing (attenuating a molten polymer strand with air), and then got interested in open source and the semantic web.
