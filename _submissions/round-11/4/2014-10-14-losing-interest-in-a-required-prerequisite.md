During grad school in Slavic Studies, I needed to audit an advanced undergraduate Russian language course in order to demonstrate my Russian language skills were sufficient for the graduate program (technically it wasn't a preqrequisite, because I only needed to finish the course before graduation). Prior to starting grad school, I audited an intermediate Russian course and enjoyed it, so, since it was required, at some point I signed up to audit the advanced Russian course. I finished most of the semester's readings in the first week (it was a novel), and found the pace in the class so slow that after the third week or so of slow, stilted conversations about the first chapter of the novel, I dropped the course.

**What could have been done**

The other teacher (who had taught the intermediate course I enjoyed) could have offered an independent study course for students who wanted a more challenging "advanced Russian," maybe, but by that time I was pretty sure that I was never going to finish the degree anyway, so honestly I don't think there was anything that was really going to revive my motivation.
