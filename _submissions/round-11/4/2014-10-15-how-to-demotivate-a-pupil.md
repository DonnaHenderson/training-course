Appearance of Literature lessons is one of the few things that are invariant in  
almost all school programs in the world.  For a reason. It is one of the main  
sources of cultural awareness, it poses ethical questions, it helps in creating  
multiple links between the objects and events in life, helping us to approach  
the state of &#8220;experts&#8221; in reality.  Before the formal literature lessons  
started, I was a keen reader of fiction, both adult and children&#8217;s, as well as  
popular science, geography, and similar.

However, when the literature appeared in my school schedule, my interest  
started decreasing. I am coming from the Former Soviet Union, were pupils were  
often asked to write essays on the books they just read, with most popular  
topic template being &#8220;Why Mr X is my favourite character in book Y&#8221;. To say the  
least, I would not always even agree with such statement. Writing essays is  
good, but when your are constantly forced into narrow space and penalised for  
violating it (that&#8217;s how marking works), you start losing motivation for  
good writing and then even, by association, for reading.

In the summer following my last year in the secondary school &#8212; just before  
entering university &#8212; I read much more than I usually would, and with much  
more enjoyment as well.

Certainlly the tasks we were given in the school were not very well connected  
to real world and our own values and thoughts. They may have served the  
assessment purpose: have the pupil actually read what was demanded?  As far as  
the pupil is concerned, the only appreciable benefit in writing such essay is  
not to get too bad a mark.

Can literature be made an attracting subject? I would say yes, and even more,  
it has all the necessary elements to be: storytelling is meant to be  
interesting! Simply make the pupil feel that they are invited to read and  
write, not forced; connect the studied topics with real, today&#8217;s world  
situations, synchronise the literature and history curricula, so that they  
support each other (by the way, history lessons can also be made really  
boring). Make essay grading more flexible, or, maybe, completely abandon  
numerical grading in favour of some written feedback (should the pupils be  
graded in subjects like Literature, Music, Drawing, or PE at all, if they are  
not optional in the curriculum?).
