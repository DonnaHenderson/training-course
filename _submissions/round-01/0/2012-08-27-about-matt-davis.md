I am a software developer currently working at the [Space Telescope Science Institute][1] where I work on Python and C projects that support [Hubble][2] science. I also spend a bit of time spreading Python around the office. I’d previously worked at [NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center][3] where I wrote Python software to support atmospheric science research. I have degrees in aerospace engineering and astronomy.

I blog at <http://penandpants.com>.
