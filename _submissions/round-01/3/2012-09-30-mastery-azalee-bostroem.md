I based my questions on what I find most important in my work. I think this can generalize to most science. I would love to know the expert answer to these.

1. How do I document what I&#8217;ve done so that my work is repeatable by someone else?

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Novice:</strong> Don&#8217;t
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Intermediate:</strong> In line comments. Keep a notebook. Provide big picture information in a doc string at the beginning.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Expert: </strong>All of the above. Write a readme file. Keep examples of how to run the code. Version control the code and output as an example. <em>I haven&#8217;t ever used make files, but would this be an appropriate place for one?</em>
</p>

2. How do I write programs which I can reuse? How do I organize my work so that I can reuse it?

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Novice: </strong>Don&#8217;t write reusable programs.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Intermediate: </strong>Write short functions with optional input parameters. Keep a central program folder for each project.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Expert:</strong>
</p>

3. How do I test my code in a time efficient manner (I know this is very context specific)?

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Novice:</strong> Test everything once you&#8217;ve finished the whole program. Make sure you get the reasonable results on the analysis you wrote your program for.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Intermediate: </strong>Test each function as you write it on a know case.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Expert: </strong>Write a set of test functions? Use assertion to catch common errors?
</p>

4. How do I make my work available to others?

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Novice: </strong>Email upon request
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Intermediate: </strong>Put on shared storage location
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Expert:</strong> Use a version controlled repository
</p>

5. How do I track things I&#8217;ve tried that haven&#8217;t worked?

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Novice:</strong> Don&#8217;t
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Intermediate:</strong> Keep a notebook
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Expert:</strong>?
</p>

6. What should my code output and to where?

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Novice:</strong> Data and plots to the screen and terminal windows
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Intermediate:</strong> Data and plots written to files
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Expert: </strong>In addition to writing data and plots to files write a log detailing the execution.
