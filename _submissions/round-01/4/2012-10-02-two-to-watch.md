When you have half an hour, watch:

1.  [Therapeutic Refactoring][1], a talk by Katrina Owen.
2.  [Part 1.6][2] of the lesson I recently recorded on Unix.

The first is clearly better than the second; one of the things we&#8217;ll talk about in Round 4 is *why*. Please also have a look at [Smarter Cookie][3]: we&#8217;re going to visit it in Round 4 as well.
