I didn't have time to create a new video, but Justin had the kind forethought to tape me teaching this bit of the shell in the UCB workshop. First, I cover "man" and "apropos". This is part of my general philosophy that folks are better served by learning how to find help than by learning how to do specific things. Next, I cover "ls" and "cd" and generally paths on the command line.

It's incredibly strange to watch oneself on tape. I'd say that in general I'm surprised at how much I move my hands, but that I don't think it's a terrible thing. The actual terrible thing is probably the amount of time I spend looking at and talking to the screen behind me. I also never ask the students if they have any questions.

The exercise portion of this wasn't recorded, but you can tell that, during this section, folks are expected to be typing along.
