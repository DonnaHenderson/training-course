I liked reading and discussing *How Learning Works*. It was fruitful for me to think about what I liked in my past teachers and how I can bring those qualities to my boot camps. Also to have specifically called out &#8220;expert blind spot&#8221; and to learn about strategies for mitigating that. Different people came up with very different responses so it was valuable to see all those.

I agree with Azalee that the general lack of feedback/discussion was disappointing, though I&#8217;m not sure I was any better than anyone else on this. Maybe meetings in IRC would enable more dynamic and voluminous discussion. Also maybe Disqus comments instead of WordPress so that we don&#8217;t have to log in to leave comments. That three step process is a little annoying.
