I liked reading and discussing *How Learning Works*. It was fruitful for me to think about what I liked in my past teachers and how I can bring those qualities to my boot camps. Also to have specifically called out "expert blind spot" and to learn about strategies for mitigating that. Different people came up with very different responses so it was valuable to see all those.

I agree with Azalee that the general lack of feedback/discussion was disappointing, though I'm not sure I was any better than anyone else on this. Maybe meetings in IRC would enable more dynamic and voluminous discussion. Also maybe Disqus comments instead of WordPress so that we don't have to log in to leave comments. That three step process is a little annoying.
