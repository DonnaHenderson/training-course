Reading [Mark Guzdial&#8217;s &#8220;MOOC are a fundamental misperception&#8230;&#8221;][1] got me thinking about what happens at a university. I&#8217;m not a researcher of computing education, so I only have my own experience to go on. I learnt 3 things at university: the theory of finite automata; graph theory; and what a co-routine is. Technically, 6 things if you also count punting, juggling, and typography.

I learnt about finite automata because I was exposed to Unix in my 3rd year and wanted to know how *grep* was implemented. Knuth, Regular Expressions, DFAs, NFAs. I did all that basically on my own, in the library. The following year I did take a a compulsory course on finite automata for my diploma in computer science, and it was better. The course lectured by someone competent was definitely of benefit. Hard to say whether I learnt more stumbling around the library on my own, or guided by an actual theoretical computer scientist. But I learnt in both cases.

Graph Theory I learnt at the knee of Béla Bollobás. I went to his lectures, and (some of) his supervisions. And that was all good. But I felt I really learnt it when I took myself off to South Wing 6 with a copy of the course text pulled off the shelf and left in a corner so that nobody else could find it (if I&#8217;d borrowed it then someone might have recalled it and I&#8217;d have to return it, but as long at is was physically in the library, they&#8217;d have to find it before they could borrow it). It was an enlightening moment for me; for the first time I realised I could learn a course, pretty well, by reading the set text carefully. Graph Theory is a pretty hard course, and I am not a strong mathematician. If I could learn that, I could do anything!

Coroutines I learnt after my graduate supervisor Arthur Norman handed me a crib sheet explaining how to transform a simple lisp program into continuation passing style and suggested that my project be an implementation of a Lisp-like language with coroutines. He didn&#8217;t just kick me out of his office, we spent an hour going over it first. Then I learnt about Simula, coroutines in BCPL and TRIPOS, Knuth&#8217;s self-modifying MIX, and so on. Mostly from dusty volumes in the lab&#8217;s library.

So what&#8217;s the story here? Can a MOOC do this? I&#8217;m really not sure, I think I&#8217;d do pretty well with a MOOC though I&#8217;ve never taken one. The stories are are not particular simple. Different learning strategies are mixed together, some lecture, some one-to-one, some self-directed research. Is this what a university does well? Here&#8217;s what I think a university does well: clever people who are motivated to learn (faculty and students); good libraries; some course content. Obviously I went to a lot of lectures at university, but looking back I wonder if those lectures did little more than provide a framework on which learning was to hang.
