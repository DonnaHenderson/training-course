I don't know that I'm an expert on the file system, but I figured since I'm pretty weak on shell scripting (I avoid it in favor of Python), I'd work on that.

## Novice {#novice}

*   Knows files exist
*   Can create files using applications with GUIs and invoking the "Save" or "Save As..." commands
*   Knows directories exist
*   Uses graphical utilities to examine <span class="GRcorrect">contents</span> of directories
*   Uses graphical utilities to navigate <span class="GRcorrect">file system</span>
*   Has heard of "the command line" or "the shell", but rarely uses it
*   Logs in via graphical user interface

*   Can invoke the command line in their OS using a terminal emulator
*   Can log in via the command line
*   Can check user ID
*   Can print current working directory
*   Has <span class="GRcorrect">big picture view</span> of <span class="GRcorrect">filesystem organization</span>; there is a root directory, and that there exist standard system locations for certain types of files

*   Can use command line to examine <span class="GRcorrect">contents</span> of directories
