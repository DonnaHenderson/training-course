The date for this one totally passed me be. Sorry.

Today I&#8217;ll be talking about *dealing with other people&#8217;s code*, specifically, into what components this skill can be divided, and at what stages of competence we might expect to see these components being used.

### Novice

*   Aware that other people write code. 
    *   Can only use other people&#8217;s code if it clearly and instantly solves the exact problem they have in hand at the moment they seek a solution. 
        *   Often overwhelmed by mass availability of 3rd part code on internet, and has no idea which ones might be a good idea to use. 
            *   Only uses other people&#8217;s code when supervisor has made it a condition of getting PhD.  
                ### Competent Boot Camp Graduate
                
                *   Assesses third party libraries / software components using a mixture of objective (has a README, has a bug tracker) and subjective (smells bad) factors. 
                    *   Can identify which libraries are likely to be useful in solving a particular research problem. 
                        *   Can sometimes identify bugs in other people&#8217;s code; adds bugs to bug tracker. 
                            *   Has developed an intuition for when it might be time to search online to see if anyone has written code to solve this problem before. 
                                *   Can compile other people&#8217;s code. If it&#8217;s bug free and there is a well written README.  
                                    ### Expert
                                    
                                    *   Makes plans to minimise the risk of using 3rd party code in critical parts of an application. 
                                        *   Can replace 3rd code by rewriting it where necessary. 
                                            *   Is able to make the buy/build decision for 3rd party code. By &#8220;buy&#8221; here I don&#8217;t mean literally buy because a lot of code is gratis now, but by using &#8220;buy&#8221; I do mean to include all the latent costs associated with using someone else&#8217;s program. 
                                                *   Contributes to 3rd party code by making pull requests. 
                                                    *   Can debug other people&#8217;s code. Sometimes even the grad student&#8217;s code that looks like it was designed by hamsters on crystal meth. 
                                                        *   Can package (apt-get, pip, npm) 3rd party code in order to make it more widely available.
