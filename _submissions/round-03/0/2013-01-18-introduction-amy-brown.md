I'm definitely the odd one out in this study group, but I suppose it's only fair to introduce myself if I'm going to be participating.

I'm an editor and self-publishing consultant; I worked with Greg on the [AOSA][1] books, and most recently I edited and helped publish a book on [schizophrenia][2]. I'm now working with Greg on Software Carpentry. I have a personal interest in psychology, with a particular focus (lately) on learning and teaching. My background is in Math and CS --- I have a math degree and I worked in software for about a decade.
