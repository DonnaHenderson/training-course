I&#8217;m a scientist at the <a title="The University of Dundee" href="http://www.dundee.ac.uk" target="_blank">University of Dundee</a> where I currently work on proteomics, doing the complex things that routine software can&#8217;t handle. Previous projects include the potato genome, phosphoproteomics in sleeping sickness, functional annotation (as part of the ELM project) and forays into protein crystallography and kinetics.<figure style="width: 640px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Initially from a wet lab background (my PhD was structure function analysis on the blood coagulation proteases) I would describe myself as a bioinformatics toolmaker and educator. Fun toys that I use in teaching include Gigsaw (http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/gigsaw) which shows that sequence assembly can be done by nursery school kids as well as by undergrads.<figure style="width: 640px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Current educational interests include developing the bioinformatics components of our Life Sciences undergraduate and postgraduate training programs.
