I am currently a PhD student in Professor Geoffrey J. Barton&#8217;s bioinformatics group at the University of Dundee, UK. My undergraduate degree is a B.S. Biochemistry (Hons) with a minor in Mathematics from Lafayette College, US. My first experience with Software Carpentry was attending a Bootcamp at the University of Newcastle in October 2012. I was interested in getting a bit more involved with SWC, so shortly after, I ventured to be a helper at the University of EdinburghÂ Bootcamp in December. As I have done quite a bit of tutoring and teach assisting, for General Chemistry Laboratory at Lafayette and various biological science undergraduate courses at Dundee, I am rather interested in both expanding my teaching repertoire and enhancing my effectiveness in teaching.
