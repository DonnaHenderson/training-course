I am a PhD student in Evolution, Ecology and Organismal Biology at the University of North Carolina and a research assistant in the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center&#8217;s informatics group where I build tools for making phylogenies more accessible. My research is in computational large-scale ecology and involves large, heterogeneous datasets. As an undergraduate, I worked with Ethan White of Utah State Univeristy (also involved in SWC.) I&#8217;ve attended SWC workshops at both USU and UNC. I taught myself to program at a young age (in QBASIC) and am passionate about sharing that knowledge with others, and I&#8217;ve seen the huge transformation that research labs can undergo after learning some basic skills like simple text file manipulation in Python and version control.
