I&#8217;m a physics PhD candidate, and I work on simulations of galaxy clusters.  My goals with Software Carpentry are to (a) help others solidify and pick up tools that let them do their jobs efficiently and effectively, and (b) solidify and pick up tools that enable me to do more and better science.  I also greatly value mediums through which science and technology become logistically and conceptually accessible to the broader community.
