I'm a DPhil/PhD candidate at the University of Oxford's Doctoral Training Centre. I've only started to do programming year (mainly in Python, R, a bit of C) as I come from a biochemistry background --- however, with biologists' increasing reliance on computational tools in today's research, I feel that programming should now be an integral component for any biology-based degree.Â I know how overwhelming it can be for someone without any prior experience, and I am attending this training course to hopefully help those around me to learn to use programming as a key part of their work.
