I’m currently a post-doctoral researcher at Penn State University.  I honestly don’t know how to classify myself as a scientist.  I have a bachelor’s degree in Biochemistry and a MS and PhD in Plant Biology, but I’m basically a microbial ecologist who studies plant (and sometimes Human) associated fungi and bacteria.  My computer skills developed a decade ago as I started at the command line to do phylogenetic analyses of gene sequences.  In the last five years I’ve tried to develop my programming skills to deal with a deluge of genomic data from new sequencing technologies.  My recent time has been spent working on several &#8220;big data&#8221; microbial and plant genome sequencing projects and metagenomic studies with soil and animal gut microbiomes.  While I still spend most of my time using command line tools, I code most frequently using the languages R and Python and very rarely use Perl.  I also enjoy web programming and have become fairly proficient in JavaScript (including D3), PHP, and MySQL for communicating data via the web.  I’ve been involved in teaching a few bioinformatics workshops and semester long courses, but I’m here to attempt to take my teaching skills to new levels.  I&#8217;m very excited and honored to be involved with Software Carpentry.
