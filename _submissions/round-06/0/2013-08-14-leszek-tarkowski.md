I'm running a small company [czterybity.pl][1] (in polish: four bits) focused on teaching C, C++ and Python. I'm cooperating with another small company --- [infotraining.pl][2], but I'm afraid both web pages are currently polish-only.

I've got  PhD in materials science, preceded by MSc in physics but after quite long time as scientist in [IMIM][3] I have left academia. My experience as a programmer is based of my needs for data processing and visualization. But I have found (with sense of relief) that my colleagues were more interested with my programming skills than with my research in my main field. And I've found that I'm quite good at explaining ideas. So in 2006 I've started to conduct trainings, which is now my primary source of satisfaction.

I'm living in Kraków, Poland. I consider myself as addicted reader, never going out without some kind of book. I'm enjoying listening to good jazz music.
