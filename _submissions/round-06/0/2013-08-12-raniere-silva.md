I&#8217;m a undergraduate student of Applied Mathematics at [University of Campinas][1] from Brazil. I study linear programming methods (e.g. simplex, interior points and branch-and-bounds) and try to write some codes for improving some implementations of this methods. Last semester, I helped teaching some computational skill for new members of the laboratory where I work (more information, only in portuguese, at <http://www.lpoo.ime.unicamp.br/rc>).

I&#8217;m a free software and open science advocate in my free time.
