I am a PhD Candidate in Computational & Systems Biology at Washington University in Saint Louis. I study the resistance and resiliency of  gut microbial communities to perturbation, especially by antibiotic treatment and invasion by exogenous microbes. Before studying microbial community dynamics I studied computer science and worked as a software engineer at Boeing. I&#8217;ve assisted in [teaching java courses to middle school students][1] and am an active volunteer with [The Young Scientist Program][2] at Wash U. I use python in my research daily and I&#8217;m excited to learn more about how to teach computational know-how to beginners. I [tweet][3] sometimes, mostly about science.
