I am a Research and Instrument Analyst at the Space Telescope Science Institute.  I work on calibrating the Mid-Infrared Instrument to go on the James Webb Space Telescope (launch date set for 2018) and I also work on reducing data for the Hubble Legacy Archive.  I have had a lot of help from more experienced programmers to get to this point and I&#8217;m excited to help others in the same way.
