I did my PhD in computational particle physics, and just finished a post-doc last year.  My work involved a lot of programming, but I have started to realize that there is a lot of room for improvement in the way people design programs in academia.  Right now I am interested in machine learning and data science, and am looking for jobs in these areas.  During my academic career I always took on teaching, even when I didn&#8217;t have to, because I enjoyed it.  I am very excited to work on my teaching skills, and hopefully to introduce people working in academia to new, efficient coding techniques and tools.
