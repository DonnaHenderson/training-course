I just graduated from the University of British Columbia this spring with a Masters degree in mathematics.  Throughout my academic career I&#8217;ve dabbled in computing / programming and always really enjoyed it.  I&#8217;ve also always been interested in teaching and developing educational resources.  Needless to say, I&#8217;m \*really\* excited about putting all these interests together through this Software Carpentry training.
