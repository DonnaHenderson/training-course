I am a systems engineer and open source contributor with nearly 13 years of professional experience. I have a Bachelors in Computer Engineering and an M.S. in computer science. , the Masters being the conscious decision. Most of my experience is in academic environment and I am presently employed at the University of Oklahoma. I volunteer for STEM efforts, local community programs and Open source communities. This allows for my personal growth and constant learning and applying the practice to theory. When I am not working I love reverse engineering exercises a.k.a. breaking stuff to understand how they actually work and anything to do in the great outdoors. If you are a fellow hiker/bicyclist, one virtual high five arriving your way!
