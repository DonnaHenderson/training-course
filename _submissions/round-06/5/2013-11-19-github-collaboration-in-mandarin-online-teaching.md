I'll teaching GitHub Collaboration in Mandarin (the very basic concept and workflows) in Thursday Nov 21(9:30 AM-10:00 AM EST). <a title="Here" href="https://github.com/HaveF/github-collaboration/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">Here</a> is the teaching material. The only prerequisite is you need to have a GitHub account(Of course you need to know the basic of Git).

Thanks a lot to those who are able to attend.
