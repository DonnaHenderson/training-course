Hi.

I'm Markus Binsteiner, Systems & Software developer at the Centre for eResearch in Auckland. The main focus of my work is trying to make HPC (High Performance Computing) as easy as possible for researchers, mainly in regards to workflows, writing scripts and user interfaces. I hope this here might open up a few new possibilities in that overall space. Before moving to New Zealand I was working in a similar role for VPAC in Melbourne for a couple of years.

On a sidenote, in a former life I've been a cabinet maker. So, naturally, I never held carpenters in a particular high esteem. Quite the opposite, in fact. But I can see why you didn't want to name this course "software cabinet making"...
