Neal Davis is a recent PhD graduate in nuclear engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.  He is currently looking for a postdoctoral position in high-performance computing and/or nuclear materials science.  Neal has been programming since age ten (QBasic on DOS 6.2), but it&#8217;s as piecemeal an education as you&#8217;re liable to find.  Now it&#8217;s primarily C/C++/Objective-C, with a little Python thrown in—and Haskell on the way (?).  His hobbies in addition to programming include armchair philosophy, military history, and fine typography.
