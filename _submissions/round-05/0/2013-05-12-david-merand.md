I am currently lecturing in the area of Mathematics Education at the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. I am especially interested in using tools for visualizing mathematical data in areas such as bioinformatics. My previous life was in large-scale financial systems and database design. I also dabble in machine learning, functional programming languages and parallel processing.
