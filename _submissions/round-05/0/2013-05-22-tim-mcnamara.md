Tim McNamara is the Communities and Communications Programme Lead at the [New Zealand eScience Infrastructure][1]. His job is to connect researchers with supercomputers and other tools to help them accelerate their research.

Outside of work, he is a fairly big supporter of Python in New Zealand. He was the conference director for [Kiwi Pycon 2011][2] and is on the organising committee of this year&#8217;s conference to be held in early September in Auckland. Closer to the software carpentry world, he has organised [beginner programming workshops][3] with a focus on adding to the diversity of the New Zealand Python community.

Tim is a self-taught programmer and GNU/Linux user. You can see his code contributions on [GitHub][4], [Bitbucket][5] and [other][6] [places][7]. He has worked professionally as a programmer at [Boost New Media][8] (Rails),  [Dragonfly Science][9] (Django) and the [Open Knowledge Foundation][10] (various).

He is also a member of [Open New Zealand][11] and is a strong proponent of open government data. At various times, he harbours naïve aspirations of solving the world&#8217;s problems through enhancing connectedness and diffusion of knowledge. Accordingly, Tim spends too much time lamenting the lack of widespread adoption of RDF and ubiquitous open linked data.
