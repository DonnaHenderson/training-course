I work as web and database programmer for the University of Waterloo Library.  I have an educational background in philosophy and logic and medieval languages and literature.  I&#8217;ve also pursued computational and corpus linguistics.  I&#8217;ve been interested in educational theory since I noticed in grade school that many teachers did a poor job of it.  I&#8217;ve done a lot of tutoring and teaching since high school in math, logic, and linguistics.
