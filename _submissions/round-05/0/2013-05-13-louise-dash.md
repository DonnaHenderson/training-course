I'm a teaching fellow in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at University College London, with special responsibility for teaching computing to undergrads. My PhD and research background is in theoretical and computational condensed-matter physics, where I've mostly used Fortran. I'm a relatively recent convert to Python, especially as a tool for understanding fundamental concepts in physics.
