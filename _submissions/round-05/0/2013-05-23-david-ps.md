I am doing a post-doc at the space-weather group at the <a href="http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/" target="_blank">Finnish Meteorological Institute</a>. My PhD is in Solar Physics but after that I've been getting more and more specialised in data processing, heliospheric data archives and event catalogues.  One of the task I've been doing most is to implement other scientists' code into a grid infrastructure.  That demonstrated me that we don't have enough formation as programmers --- that's why I'm here, to learn how to teach my colleagues the best practices.  In my opinion, "sharing" is a must on science.
