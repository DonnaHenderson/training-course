I am a consultant at BlueFern supercomputing, University of Canterbury, New Zealand. Originally from South Korea, I did algorithm and data structure research for Ph.D and worked in software industry for 6 years before joining BlueFern. I am interested in making programming more accessible and less frightening for people with little programming background.
