I am a postdoctoral fellow in computational molecular biology at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I work at the Joint Genome Institute, where I maintainÂ synthetic biology software when I&#8217;m not doing research. I would like to know how to bring interested but fearful non-programming scientists into the fold.
