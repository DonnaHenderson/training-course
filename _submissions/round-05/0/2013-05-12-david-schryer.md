David is a systems biologist who specializes in the simulation of dynamic isotope transients in large metabolic systems, analysis of dynamic [SILAC][1] data and associated proteomics data, and various other tasks that require automated data analysis &#8212; including &#8212; alignment and trimming of next-generation sequencing data, classification of large sets of proteins, building and testing statistical models, and generation of visual reports on large data sets.  All of these tasks are accomplished using Python (often to generate and wrap C code for speed), LaTeX, and GNU/Linux tools.  In addition, David runs [ScientificScribe.com][2] which provides technical editing and professional LaTeX typesetting.
