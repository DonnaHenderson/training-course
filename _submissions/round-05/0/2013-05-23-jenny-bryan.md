I'm faculty at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, half in Statistics and half in the Michael Smith Labs, which is an interdisciplinary, biotechnology-ish unit. I'm trained as a biostatistician and I'm specialized in genomics. I've been using R (or its predecessors!) since the mid 1990s (zoinks!) and have recently taught in a few R-flavored Software Carpentry Bootcamps. I also teach alot of related content in my regular faculty life. So, I'm eager to learn more about how students learn --- esp. in matters of programming! Would love to become more effective and satisfied in my role as educator.
