I&#8217;m faculty at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, half in Statistics and half in the Michael Smith Labs, which is an interdisciplinary, biotechnology-ish unit. I&#8217;m trained as a biostatistician and I&#8217;m specialized in genomics. I&#8217;ve been using R (or its predecessors!) since the mid 1990s (zoinks!) and have recently taught in a few R-flavored Software Carpentry Bootcamps. I also teach alot of related content in my regular faculty life. So, I&#8217;m eager to learn more about how students learn &#8212; esp. in matters of programming! Would love to become more effective and satisfied in my role as educator.
