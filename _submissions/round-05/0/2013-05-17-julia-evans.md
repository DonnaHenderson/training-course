I'm a programmer and data scientist living in Montréal, Canada. I have a M.Sc in computer science from [McGill University][1] where I studied quantum computing, and I've been working as a programmer for the last 2 years. Recently I've been teaching intro to programming workshops with [Montréal Python][2] and I'd like to get better at teaching beginners how to program.
