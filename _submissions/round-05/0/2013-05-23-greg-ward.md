I am a programmer and open-source hacker with nearly 25 years of professional experience. I have a B.Sc. in physics and an M.Sc. in computer science, and not doing more graduate work is one of the best decisions I never took (it just sorta happened). I worked in an academic lab in the mid-nineties, and have been in various flavours of software industry since then. Recently I&#8217;ve dabbled in teaching newbies basic programming, and surprisingly had a blast. More please!
