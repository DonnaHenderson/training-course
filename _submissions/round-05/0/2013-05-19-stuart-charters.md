I&#8217;m a Senior Lecturer at Lincoln University, New Zealand in the Department of Applied Compuing.  Originally from the UK, I did my Bsc(Hons) and PhD at Durham University in Computer Science. During my PhD I got involved in eScience projects in the UK and looked at developing Service Oriented Visualisation Pipelines for Scientific Visualisation.  
In New Zealand I have been heavily involved in the BeSTGRID project and also with the National eScience Infrastructure (NeSI).  At Lincoln I teach Software Engineering and am also the eResearch Champion for the University encouraging other researchers to make use of HPC and Distributed Computing.  I am particularly interested in the &#8220;on ramp&#8221; for researchers making the transition to HPC from environments like R and Matlab.
