Slow TCP connect times can be caused by slow DNS lookups, long round-trip time or firewalls (the latter causing infinite connect time). The screencast would touch on the three stages (DNS lookup, routing, server acceptance) and demonstrate using the dig, ping and traceroute tools to measure the various elapsed times involved.
