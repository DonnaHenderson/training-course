Using git can often go smoothly for a while, change, commit, push, change commit push etc

But then someone else working on the same repo, and you go to merge their changes and git comes back telling you to resolve conflicts. Waaaaah. Dealing with merge conflicts can be painful, and many novice to intermediate users will just give up at this point.

I&#8217;ll show how to use the visual merge tool that comes as part of XCode on a Mac, including how to set gitconfig, and basic use of the tool.

I expect a bunch of work in setting up this screencast will just be in creating the sample merge conflicts.
