Sorry I'm a bit late on this---I've been traveling lately. I'll have the screencast posted in the next few days.

Debugging tools in R can help the user find problems in his or her programming quickly and efficiently. While R is generally a pretty friendly language, the problems that arise can be quite different from other languages (e.g. C or C++).  I'll show how to use several built-in debugging tools in R.

&nbsp;

General Outline:

1) How R reports problems in function execution: errors and warnings

2) Print the call stack with **traceback**

3) Stepping through the problem with **debug**

4) Inserting code with **trace **

5) Optional: using **browser** and **recover**

If this proves to be too lengthy for the 3 minute limit, I'll focus on one or two debugging tools.
