I was thinking of doing a short (< 3 mins) explanation of how to rescue your code(not always possible) when you do "`git reset --hard`" with mistake.

Git users are told to use "`git reset --hard`" carefully, it could erase all your endeavor in seconds. Because people use it less than other commands,  
it is a dangerous and error prone command. In some circumstances, you are luck to mend your mistake, I'll show you how to do that.

What do you think?
