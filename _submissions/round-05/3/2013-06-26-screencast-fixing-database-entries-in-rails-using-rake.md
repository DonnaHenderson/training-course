at openSNP we've got some old SNPs in the database that have a linebreak in their position, for example: "42184912n". For the screencast, I thought of writing a tiny Rake-task that iterates over all SNPs and fixes their position.

The resulting script would beÂ just around 5 lines, but already touch on a few "advanced" Rails-things: Usage of "find\_each" instead of "find" when many records are present, or why "update\_attributes" works the way it works, or the difference between "gsub" and "gsub!"

Does that make sense?
