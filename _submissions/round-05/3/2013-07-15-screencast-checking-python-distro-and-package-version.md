Here&#8217;s a quick tutorial I put together on determining which version of python you&#8217;re using, as well as determining which version of a particular package you&#8217;re using.  It briefly covers the &#8220;PATH&#8221; in the shell and in python, as well as some tools we have for disambiguating multiple distributions/packages.
