Thank you all once again for your entries for [Round 5.4][1]: we had a lot of good discussion, particularly when the morning group wandered off-track for a few minutes and discussed how to handle learners, helpers, and co-instructors who want to grab the steering wheel.

Our [next and final round][2] is the graduation exercise. We have a full month to do it—we&#8217;ll be meeting on August 29 and again on September 3 to wrap it up—and the goal is to do one complete lesson from conception to delivery.

1.  Pick a *small* topic that is either part of the core of Software Carpentry, or closely related—something that can be taught in 8-10 minutes.
2.  Write a three-line blog post outlining your topic, so that other people know what you&#8217;re working on and can give you feedback. Please try to get this up right away, and put it in [Round 5.5][2].
3.  Create a concept map for your topic and add it to your blog post. (You&#8217;ll be extending your initial blog post in this exercise rather than writing multiple posts.)
4.  Create two questions you could use *after* teaching to determine whether your learners had grasped the key idea or not. Your goal here is to distinguish competent practitioners from novices; we&#8217;re not worried about experts in this round. Add these to your post.
5.  Create your lesson materials. These can include any of an IPython Notebook, PowerPoint slides, a couple of hand-drawn sketches, a video, or anything else—it&#8217;s up to you. Again, post these on the blog.
6.  Deliver the lesson in front of an audience. 2-3 people is enough, and if you can&#8217;t talk your office mates into attending, you can try delivering it online. Get feedback from your audience, add that to your blost post, and woo hoo, you&#8217;re done.

And that&#8217;s it: once you&#8217;ve done this, and we&#8217;ve discussed it, you&#8217;ll be ready to help teach your first workshop.

I&#8217;m offline from August 3 to August 12—if you have questions while I&#8217;m gone, please post &#8216;em to this list and come to a consensus answer. I hope you have fun with this, and I look forward to your lessons.

*Later:*

1.  Your choices don&#8217;t have to be unique: it&#8217;s OK if several people choose the same topic.
2.  As I said in the evening session, the best training I ever had for teaching was a one-day improv comedy workshop. If any of you would like to do that, please find something near you and let me know—I&#8217;ll cover any reasonable cost. If you can go with colleagues (either from your lab, or from this group), it&#8217;ll be even more fun <img src="http://localhost:8080/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />
