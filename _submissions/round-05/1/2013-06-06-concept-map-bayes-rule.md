Bayes' rule is always kind of difficult to explain because fundamentally, it is just an equation, but it is an equation that has a lot of implications and provides a structured way of thinking about how learning/incorporating evidence works in a wide range of contexts. I tried to capture that here, by explaining how it's used and what each of its terms means on an intuitive level.

Apologies for being late, I missed the first meeting and did a poor job of checking to see that there was an assignment.
