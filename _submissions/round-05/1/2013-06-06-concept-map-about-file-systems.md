This is actually something I&#8217;m working on to explain the different file systems to my colleagues at the Joint Genome Institute.  It&#8217;s not static, so I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s exactly what everyone else was thinking when writing up concept maps, but I think the general idea is similar.  There are a few bubbles and connections leading to those bubbles, but there are drill downs within.  It&#8217;s more of a dynamic concept map that I think are pretty cool when presenting new ideas.
