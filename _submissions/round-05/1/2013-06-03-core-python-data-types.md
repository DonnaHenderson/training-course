This is my attempt at trying to give a high-level organization to the core built-in Python data types and their uses.  I avoided including other 'types' like object, type, etc. to simplify the map as well as gear it towards beginners.  I think including things like the base 'object' and other more infrastructure data types would have made the overall concept harder to grasp.

I'd like to think this is how I would begin to explain the 'batteries included' philosophy of Python to **very** beginning Python developers.  So, I chose to organize it in a way that could provide students with a quick way to look up the proper data type assuming they already know the problem they want to solve like 'simple math' or 'store a list of unordered information.'
