1) Which of the following regular expressions will match only the string &#8220;42&#8221; from the string

&#8220;42 bottles of beer on the 3 walls&#8221;

a) &#8220;^[^ ]+&#8221;  
b) &#8220;0-90-9&#8243;  
c) &#8220;[0-9]+&#8221;  
d) &#8220;42&#8221;  
e) &#8220;..&#8221;  
f) &#8220;dw&#8221;

2) In which of these scenarios is it possible to use regular expressions to write a program which always produces the correct answer? (choose as many as apply)

a) Matching (North American) telephone numbers formatted like (xxx) xxx-xxxx  
b) **(edited, after Ted&#8217;s comment)** Finding all list literals in a Python program (like [1,2,3], [&#8216;cow&#8217;, &#8216;red&#8217;, &#8216;dog&#8217;])  
c) Matching telephone numbers with one of several possible formats (xxx) xxx-xxxx, xxxxxxxxxx, xxx xxx-xxxx  
d) Writing a program to help cheat at crosswords (8-letter words that look like qu??t??n)  
e) Finding a span tag with class &#8220;blah&#8221; in a HTML document and all its contents
