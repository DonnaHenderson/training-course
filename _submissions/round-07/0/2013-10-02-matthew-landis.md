I have a Ph.D. in Ecology, but now I'm a geographer with a small consulting company (www.isciences.com) where I work at the interface between environmental issues and society, especially with regard to water and climate change.  I also teach a course on visualizing data at Middlebury College in Vermont, USA.  I am a self-taught programmer and I use R and Python daily.
