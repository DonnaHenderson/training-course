I'm a nuclear physicist and software developer currently working at TRIUMF, where I'm responsible for building web-based UI for our new experiments, and overseeing the broader software development campaign for the GRIFFIN experiment. Â Before this I got my PhD coding for the ATLAS experiment on the LHC at CERN; my experiences in experimental physics have made it clear to me that my field has amassed a terrible technical debt thanks to its poor relationship with coding best practices, and I am participating in Software Carpentry to try and begin closing this crippling gap.
