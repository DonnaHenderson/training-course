I am a PhD candidate in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Program at Iowa State University where I work on the intersection between microbial and ecosystem ecology.  I do most of my work in R, though I have been introduced to other languages and concepts taught during SWC bootcamps.  I hope to learn how to be a better teacher, pick up some new skills, and empowering others to use their computers more effectively!
