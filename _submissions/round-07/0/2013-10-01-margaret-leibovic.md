I have a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from MIT. For the past three years, I have been working as a software developer at Mozilla in San Francisco. I currently work on the Firefox for Android front-end team, but I've also worked on desktop Firefox and Firefox OS. I love open source and the web, and I'm always excited to help new developers get involved in both!
