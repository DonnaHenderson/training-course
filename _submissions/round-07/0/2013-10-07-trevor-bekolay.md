I'm a theoretical neuroscientist working on my PhD at the University of Waterloo. My background is mostly in computer science, but my interest in teaching and learning compelled me to study the brain. It has been eye-opening seeing the Matlab scripts neuroscientists cobble together, so I hope through Software Carpentry to improve the quality of neuroscientific research by teaching good programming practices.
