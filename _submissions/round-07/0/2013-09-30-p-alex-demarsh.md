I&#8217;m a PhD student studying Epidemiology and Biostatistics at McGill University, and an Epidemiologist with the Government of Canada. I&#8217;ve been thoroughly convinced that the potential gains of bridging software engineering principles and the practice of science are enormous, and I&#8217;m excited to contribute in a small way. I&#8217;m relatively new to coding but have reasonable comfort using R and Python for statistical programming, and with the set of productivity tools advocated by SWC. Through this program I hope to build up my own toolbox, and learn how to effectively share what I learn with others scientists and students.
