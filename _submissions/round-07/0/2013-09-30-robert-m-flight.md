My PhD is in Analytical Chemistry, but my research involved the computational analysis of gene expression data. I am currently a PostDoc in Bioinformatics in the Center for Environmental Systems Biochemistry at the University of Kentucky. In addition to combining -omics analyses, I am interested in open science and teaching others how to make computational science reproducible.
