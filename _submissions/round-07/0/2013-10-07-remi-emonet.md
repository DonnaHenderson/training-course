I&#8217;m an associate professor in computer science at a French university (in Saint Étienne). I hold a software engineering diploma and a Ph.D. in computer science and my research interests range from computer vision to machine learning to data mining. I like making presentations to my colleagues on important subjects <img src="http://localhost:8080/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> : git, inkscape, dvorak keyboard, … I also like staying up to date with technology and contributing to open source projects (mostly on the deck.js project lately).
