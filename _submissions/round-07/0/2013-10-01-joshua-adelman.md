I am a computational biophysicist and postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pittsburgh. My research involves trying to understand how membrane proteins facilitate the movement of small molecules into and out of the cell and the development of computational tools to enable the sampling of rare events in molecular simulation. I have a strong interest in building open source tools, teaching Python and bringing software dev best practices to basic science.
