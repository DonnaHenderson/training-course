I&#8217;m a research librarian and informationist at the Univ of Massachusetts Medical School. I provide data, knowledge, and information management services to several research teams on campus. I&#8217;m also an exercise physiologist, a mandolin player, and a <a title="A Librarian by Any Other Name" href="http://librarianhats.net" target="_blank">blogger</a>.
