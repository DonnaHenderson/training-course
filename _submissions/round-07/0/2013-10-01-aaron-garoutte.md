I am an &#8220;Macro&#8221; Ecologist turned Microbial Ecologist.  I&#8217;m currently a PhD student at Michigan State University studying plant-microbe interactions using &#8220;-omics&#8221;.  I use shell, python and R to analyze my data and I would like to get some experience teaching and become a more proficient programer.
