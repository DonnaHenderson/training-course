I am a computational scientist working on an biologics project with Schrodinger, a software company that develops scientific simulation software for biotechnology and pharmaceutical applications. I am currently based in Cambridge and use an array of scripting tools for work.  I am always interested in picking up new skills and  teaching what I know to help others.
