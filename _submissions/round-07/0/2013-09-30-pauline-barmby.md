I'm an associate professor in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at the University of Western Ontario. I'm an observational astrophysicist who uses as many telescopes as possible to study nearby galaxies. I have been writing Python code for more than 10 years but that doesn't mean I'm good at it (or teaching anyone else to do it) yet..
