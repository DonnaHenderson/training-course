A mathematician by training I am now in the midst of a PhD Program in Computational Biology in Bergen, Norway. My project tackles the problem of gene networks regulation by microRNAs. I want to systemize and expand my knowledge in scientific computing as well as share it with other people who may be struggling with the same questions I did (and do).
