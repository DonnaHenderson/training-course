I am a Project Manager by day and I teach classes three nights a week in Linux and Programming in C, Assembly, Visual Basic and shell scripting. I am passionate about programming. I know about a dozen languages and enjoy learning about new tools and techniques to use in my teaching and on my consulting projects.
