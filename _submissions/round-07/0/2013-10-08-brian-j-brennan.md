I work at the Mozilla Foundation as a software developer/architect on the OpenBadges project.

I live in Brooklyn, NY and in addition to working on software, I play bass guitar and I try to write short stories. I studied Creative Writing and Philosophy in college, but that was several years ago at this point and possibly irrelevant. I've also been a radio DJ and worked doing bioinformatics in a genetics lab.
