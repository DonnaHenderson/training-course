I am a mathematician by training and computational scientist by job title working for STFC in the UK. I head the Software Engineering Support Centre (<a title="SESC" href="http://softeng-support.ac.uk" target="_blank">http://softeng-support.ac.uk</a>) to promote pragmatic software engineering in the computational science community. My technical work includes 3D quantification for tomographic imaging, and agent based modelling.
