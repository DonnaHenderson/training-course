Beneath are my multiple choices questions to assess the students&#8217; abilities in file navigation by using &#8220;ls.&#8221;

*   novice vs. competent

Use &#8220;ls&#8221; to view the details of all visible files in a directory, including ownership, execution rights, size, modification dates.

1.  ls -a
2.  ls -F
3.  ls -l
4.  ls -s

*   competent vs. expert

Use &#8220;ls&#8221; to view the details of all visible files in a directory, including ownership, execution rights, size (in human readable format), modification dates, and sort them by their modification dates (most recently modified file at the bottom).

1.  ls -ahstr
2.  ls -lHstr
3.  ls -aHstr
4.  ls -lhstr
