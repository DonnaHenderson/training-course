Thanks to everyone who took part in last week&#8217;s meeting to talk about making screencasts. For our next exercise, you&#8217;ll be working in pairs to develop a short lesson, and then each person will teach it live, online.

1.  If you don&#8217;t already have a partner, please mail me and I&#8217;ll match you up. (Please tell me how much you know about Git and GitHub, and what time zone you&#8217;re in.)
2.  Once you have a partner, get a copy of our existing teaching materials from [this GitHub repository][1]. If you need help with this, please let me know: we have several volunteers who&#8217;d be happy to walk you through the process.
3.  Make sure you&#8217;re in the &#8216;master&#8217; branch (not &#8216;gh-pages&#8217; or any of the others), and look in the directories &#8216;python/novice&#8217;, &#8216;bash/novice&#8217; (for the shell), &#8216;git/novice&#8217;, and &#8216;sql/novice&#8217;. There, you&#8217;ll find the materials we&#8217;re preparing to teach complete beginners starting in January.
4.  With your partner, pick a *small* topic—something you can teach in 3 minutes or less—and either fix it, rewrite it, or add it. (If you&#8217;re adding something new, please check with me first: we want to make sure this material stays suitable for beginners.)
5.  Once you&#8217;ve created something, submit a pull request to our GitHub repo. (Again, if you don&#8217;t know how to do this, we&#8217;ll help.)
6.  After your material&#8217;s been reviewed and integrated, we&#8217;ll set up a time for each person to teach it live online using something like a Google Hangout. You will *not* record video for this: instead, you&#8217;ll share your slides or your screen live and in real time.

Synchronizing with other people always takes time, so this will be a longer exercise than the previous ones. Ideally, we&#8217;d like to have lessons in and taught before the holidays, but if you&#8217;re unable to do that because of other commitments (like end-of-term madness at your university), please just let me know, and we&#8217;ll spill into January.
