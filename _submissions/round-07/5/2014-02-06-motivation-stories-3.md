**Demotivation first**

When I was learning to drive I became very discouraged. My instructor had a dual-control car so he could take over at any moment if he thought it necessary. For the first few weeks I thought things were going well, at least for a complete beginner. Everyone has the &#8220;kangaroo&#8221; petrol (gas) at first don&#8217;t they?

Then it dawned on me that I had no idea how well I was doing because he could be doing everything apart from steering for me. How was I to know I was any good? The family car was mostly used elsewhere and finding time to practice was very difficult.

I got into a downward spiral that left me completely demotivated and unable to see any way out.

Talking through my predicament with family and making time to drive that car, and asking the instructor out right how much he was actually doing was they way I eventually solved the problem.

Teaching software carpentry is not like teaching driving. Students can&#8217;t kill someone in a lesson (I hope) or damage valuable equipment; so it doesn&#8217;t matter if things go wrong when they do the exercises. We must allow students to get it wrong and learn by picking up the pieces.

**Feeling Motivated  
**

I learned piano from the age of 8, nothing spectacular but I can play for pleasure and to accompany my kids now they are learning other instruments. The thing about piano is that you can&#8217;t take one around with you! And a lot of people can play so I wanted to learn some other instrument. I&#8217;d always wanted to play trumpet so decided to learn

I asked around for a teacher and found a great lady who helped me get started. She was harsh if I didn&#8217;t practice and that added to my own motivation! I learned a lot quickly, even managing to continue through the early months with a new baby. I felt good about myself and carried on the practice and playing when my teacher moved to the US. Again I&#8217;m nothing special but can play for pleasure and have a member of my family to keep me up to scratch now.
