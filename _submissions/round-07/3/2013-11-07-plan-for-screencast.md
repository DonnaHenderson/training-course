I hope to demonstrate working in an IDLE window how to use Python and arcpy to generate folders and files of a specific type and name format, "in bulk" --- as in, for values 1-10. This is useful for large datasets that might need to be broken up into smaller chunks and making a dozen file geodatabases in Arc is....time consuming.
