I hope to demonstrate working in an IDLE window how to use Python and arcpy to generate folders and files of a specific type and name format, &#8220;in bulk&#8221; &#8211; as in, for values 1-10. This is useful for large datasets that might need to be broken up into smaller chunks and making a dozen file geodatabases in Arc is&#8230;.time consuming.
