I going to do a screencast teaching relatively new R users to write their own basic functions. The lesson will assume they&#8217;ve already learned how to write for loops and use built-in functions within R. I am currently thinking that I will write a function just to take a mean of a vector.

UPDATE: I tried to make a screencast of writing a mean function but couldn&#8217;t get it under 5 minutes with any usefulness. I decided to just do a simple power function.

Here&#8217;s the video posted via YouTube for better quality:

I also included all of my files including R markdown, HTML, and PDF of the lesson on <a href="https://github.com/djhocking/Software_Carpentry_Course/tree/master/Homework/Homework3" target="_blank">github here</a>
