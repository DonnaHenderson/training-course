I plan to do a screencast to teach the basics of git branches: what they are, why you might want to do work in a branch, and how to make a branch. I&#8217;ll assume that users know the very basics of git, or at least version control in general.

***Update*** Of course, in the end I didn&#8217;t get to nearly that much, but I hope I motivated a little bit why you might want to use branches!
