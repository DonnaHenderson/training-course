This screencast covers the basics of list comprehensions in Python.  (Sorry about the poor quality --- couldn't get it any better ---  and my ageing MacBook's fan whirring in the background.  Camtasia was giving it a hard time.) This is the first one of these I've done, so all feedback is much appreciated!



(Apologies that is is a little late, too; I was ill last week and didn't want half the audio to be me coughing!)
