I will do a quick 3 minute presentation on how to visualize data using principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS) using the vegan package in R.

&nbsp;

I uploaded the video to youtube.Â  Including both PCoA and NMDS was not feasible for the 3 minute limit, so instead I focused only on NMDS

[NMDS in R for SWC][1]
