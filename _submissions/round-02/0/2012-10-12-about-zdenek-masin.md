I am a postdoctoral researcher at The Open University in Milton Keynes, UK, where I also did my graduate studies (Ph.D. thesis submitted). I obtained degrees in General Physics (B.S.) and Theoretical Physics (M.S.) from The Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic. I work in the field of atomic and molecular physics. In particular I am performing calculations of low-energy electron collisions with molecules, using the UKRmol suite of codes:

I have been using Fortran and Mathematica for most of my calculations. However, as a part of my postdoctoral project, I have begun to explore OOP and ways it can improve functionality and sustainability of our codes.
