I&#8217;m a doctoral candidate in Sociology at Columbia University (in the City of New York), working on computational social science broadly. In the past, I&#8217;ve done social network analysis, agent-based modelling, historical-text-XML-munging and a couple of other things, the vast majority of it in Python. I also apparently do digital humanities-type-stuff, which took me by surprise.

My first two degrees were not overly quantitative, so I&#8217;m using the first couple of years at Columbia to brush up on my discrete math/calculus/stats/algorithms and data structures/ML &#8212; [SICP][1] blew my mind, and I want more of that!

I&#8217;m pretty much the only person with this name and a web presence, and you can find me at the usual places, as well as at [adamobeng.com][2].
