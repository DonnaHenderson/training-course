I am a PhD student in Computer Science & Quantitative Biology at Michigan State University. Â My research focuses on developing more efficient methods for assembling next-generation sequencing datasets, especially from environmental samples (metagenomics). I have helped to run one Software Carpentry workshop and hope to assist with more in the future as well. I have also been a TA for my advisor&#8217;s two-week workshop on analyzing next-generation sequencing data.
