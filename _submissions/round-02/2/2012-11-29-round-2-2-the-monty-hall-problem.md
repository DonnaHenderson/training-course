In this short clip I describe the Monty Hall problem, and suggest a way of understanding its somewhat counter-intuitive solution. Â The Monty Hall problem can be described [described elegantly][1] using Bayes&#8217;s theorem.

Recall that:

`<br />
P(A | B) P(B) = P(A, B)<br />
P(B | A) P(A) = P(A, B)<br />
<code>`</code>

Combining these two statements yields Bayes&#8217;s theorem:

`<br />
P(A | B) = P(B | A) P(A) / P(B)<br />
`

Bayes developed this theorem as part of his quest to prove the existence of God. For example, what is `P(god | what we observe)` is a hard problem, but a more tractable problem may be: what is `P(what we observe | god) P(god)`. In other words, this theorem is extremely useful because it allows us to &#8220;flip around&#8221; many questions in statistics.
