Here I am teaching printing one of more lines from a file using sed. The material is based on this excellent blog post: http://linuxcommando.blogspot.no/2008/03/using-sed-to-extract-lines-in-text-file.html

I noticed I forgot to explain the meaning of &#8216;p&#8217;. Otherwise I&#8217;m OK with it. I had to redo the take, as the first time my network connection failed at the end. The second time went in fact a lot better&#8230;
