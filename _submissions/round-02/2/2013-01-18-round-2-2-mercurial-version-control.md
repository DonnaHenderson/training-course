[This is posted way, way too late and there aren&#8217;t really any good excuses for me. But as some say, better late than never.]

Unfortunately I had to use a screen-capture as the camera I used could not provide a clear picture of what was displayed on the monitor/projection screen. And I admit that there were no students &#8211; the Open University offers only distance learning so&#8230;we have no students here on site.
