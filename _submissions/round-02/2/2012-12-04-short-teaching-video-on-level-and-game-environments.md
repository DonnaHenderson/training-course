I recently recorded myself delivering a short presentation and tutorial session about video game level design. The presentation was given at a session hosted by the ULCS (University of Lincoln Computing Society), who invited me as a guest speaker as part of their sessions on game development.

The talk lasted for thirty minutes, which is quite a lot more than what was expected us to record, but I did intend to record and share it anyway...

There you go:



Self critique:

--- I noticed that I do repeat myself  
--- My text was not prepared enough, some slides could be more into detail  
--- Perhaps student engagement was too forced.  
--- I don't sound too loud on the video, I'm not sure if i was loud enough during the presentation
