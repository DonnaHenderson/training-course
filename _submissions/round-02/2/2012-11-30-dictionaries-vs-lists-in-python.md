Hi, here is my short teaching video. I chose to discuss the differences between dictionaries and lists in Python. Sorry that Photobooth mirrors the image so the text is backwards.



Some observations:

1. I speak just a little too fast.  
2. I could use some pauses in between statements to let people think.  
3. Having just two people watching me really did make things seem more "real".

As soon as I stopped the video one of my audience members said, "Ohhh, I've been struggling with that all day. That makes sense now!". So, overall I'm pretty happy with how it came out.
