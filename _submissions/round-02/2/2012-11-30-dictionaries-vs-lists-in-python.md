Hi, here is my short teaching video. I chose to discuss the differences between dictionaries and lists in Python. Sorry that Photobooth mirrors the image so the text is backwards.



Some observations:

1. I speak just a little too fast.  
2. I could use some pauses in between statements to let people think.  
3. Having just two people watching me really did make things seem more &#8220;real&#8221;.

As soon as I stopped the video one of my audience members said, &#8220;Ohhh, I&#8217;ve been struggling with that all day. That makes sense now!&#8221;. So, overall I&#8217;m pretty happy with how it came out.
