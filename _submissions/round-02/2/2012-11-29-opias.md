So this is my video about emmetropia, myopia, and hyperopia. I wanted to say more but ended up cutting it short at 3 minutes. I didn&#8217;t point out that hyperopia also implies blur on the retina. Also should have mentioned the fact that lens bend light by some amount when talking about the near object.
