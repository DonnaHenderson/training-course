Here is my contribution:



In retrospect, I think it was a poor decision to use a white board to teach strings. I think that it is better to teach strings and other datatypes interactively since it allows you to experiment a bit more. I did the &#8220;lesson&#8221; without video the first time, and my wife (my entire audience) told me that she thought it was the best out of all the takes. I&#8217;m not sure if it was the anxiety of being on video or just soundingÂ over-rehearsed, but I thought it was an interesting observation. After having done a few iterations of the video, I&#8217;m still not happy with how it turned out, but it was an interesting experience to say the least.
