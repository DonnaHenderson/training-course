I spent around 8 hours doing this...but it looks like I spent 1 hour!  Things took longer because I was using sqlite3 for the first time.  I was actually using SQL for the first time as well...so comments from experienced people are welcome.  I'm also pretty much a novice with GitHub and had to wrestle with some issues there.  I used the [cmap software][1]...the install takes a while but it's easy to use.

The "why should scientists care" and code is in the notebook.  The notebook and cmap are both [here][2].
