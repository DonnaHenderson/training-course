1. Â You have created a new git repository in your current directory with the &#8216;git init&#8217; command.

Further, you have edited and saved a new file name &#8216;README&#8217; to the current directory.

What sequence of commands will permanently save the new file &#8216;README&#8217; to your repository?

a) git status; git add README; git diff &#8211;staged; git commit -m &#8220;created README&#8221;

b) git status; git commit -m &#8220;created README&#8221;; git status; git log

c) git add README; git diff &#8211;staged; git commit; git status

d) git status; git add README; git status; git diff &#8211;staged; git log

2. Files under git control go through three main stages: working files, staging area, and repository.

Draw a picture that illustrates the relationship between these three stages and the following git commands:

git add  
git checkout  
git commit
