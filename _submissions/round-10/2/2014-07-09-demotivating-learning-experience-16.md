I had a friend during college who wanted to learn German. I thought it would be an interesting experience, and so we started searching for a language school. We choose one after talking with the teacher. He was an engineer who went to Germany for a year during his PhD and decided to give German lessons while he was looking for a job.

For six months the class was awesome! He didn&#8217;t follow the textbook all that much and focused on conversation and sharing his cultural experience in Germany. And when he did follow the textbook it was a breeze for us, because we could understand why we were doing the exercises and also connect reading and writing to hearing and speaking.

But&#8230; He eventually found another job, and the school replaced him with a new teacher. This new teacher had a major in Linguistics and specialized in German. He knew a lot of theory, but he didn&#8217;t know how to speak it properly and never went to Germany. He didn&#8217;t have much experience teaching and followed the textbook religiously, focusing on grammar. After three months we quit, because the class was very boring and, if the teacher didn&#8217;t have anything else to add, we could grind the book by ourselves,.

It was a hard problem for the new teacher, since we set our standard by the first teacher&#8217;s performance. How could this be solved?

*   Having a diploma doesn&#8217;t mean you a good teacher. Maybe he focused too much on theoretical studies, but the new teacher should recognize his weak points and improve them if he wants to teach.
*   Grammar is an important part, but not the only one needed to learn a language. And preparing an interesting class is harder than just following a textbook.
