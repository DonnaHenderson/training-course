What comes to mind is an old example.

I moved from an inner city school to a county for my first year of high school. In my former environment I was encouraged to solve abstract problems (e.g. "be a lawyer for the state in a mock trial", read greek philosophy and interpert, or learn about architecture and compete to keep an egg safe when dropped from the top floor).

When I moved to the county I was expected to write well formed five paragraph essays. No credit was given to ability to construct and argument, only to properly form the essay. I had little interest in fitting an argument to five paragraphs and was confused why that was a standard when I thought learning was about love of knowledge as well as ability to relay that when needed rather than fitting an arbitrary number of paragraphs.

I dropped into remedial english after that because of grades. I also became the captain of the debate team.

I think if the english teacher had explained that good grammar and well formed sentences can be an aid in getting your point across I would have been more motivated.

I think that I bring that knowledge to work every day. By that I mean, I ultimately what to school for fine arts (BFA with no science). I got bored of that and jumped to a masters in biology. I did this with the help of many mentors. In my current, role I assess lacks and develop plans of action. I've worked with next generation sequencing data, a new (we were the second beta test location of) high throughput optical mapper, as well as education and outreach.

I happily, regularly hear that former students are doing well or that I am addressing issues that exist but have not been formally addressed. Which makes me think think that self motivation and good mentors may be as or more influential than demotivating instructors.
