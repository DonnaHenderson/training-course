During my first year in college I took an introductory course to programming.

I really liked the way the professor explaind the various algorithms, why they  
were important and how they could be useful in real-world application.

One of the first assignments was implementing a function to read some numbers from a tab delimited file and store the in a vector. We had to program in C and,  to make things easier for beginners, we had to work on vectors of fixed size.

After completing the assignment as it was asked, I got curious about how to deal  
with the case when you don&#8217;t know in advance the number of items you are going to read.  
With some extra study I could manage to understand how to  dynamically allocate a vector of the required size where to store the data.

I got quite disappointed when I presented the assignment during one of the classes in the lab and the person in charge of marking the assignment commented &#8220;OK it works, but don&#8217;t aim too high&#8221;.

This really demotivated my whole experience with the course: I simply started doing (and learning) things exactly as they were asked, without attempting anything that wasn&#8217;t explained during the classes (at the time programming was not of my primary interests).  
Should I have received some word of appreciation for the effort/initiative, I&#8217;ll have  
surely kept studying and trying to understand things in a deeper way!
