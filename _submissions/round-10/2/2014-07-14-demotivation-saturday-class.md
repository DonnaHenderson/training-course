Being the children of Chinese immigrants, my sisters and I had to attend Saturday morning Cantonese classes. Just having to attend the classes were demotivating to us because we only went because we **must do it**. As children we hated it because it was extra schooling and most importantly we were missing on our favourite Saturday morning cartoons.

It was a single experience that turned me off Cantonese classes forever and that occurred when I was either in grade five or six of elementary school so I was about 10 or 11. For an assignment we were all assigned a passage from an old Chinese story that we had to practise with our parents and recite in front of the class the next week. I was quite a shy child back then so this was a terrifying prospect. To this day I&#8217;m still really bad at pronouncing things in my mother tongue but I was particularly bad back then.

During the week my mother and I practised the passage over and over again until I thought I had got it down enough so I wouldn&#8217;t be embarrassed. The next Saturday comes and after a couple of my classmates speak it was my turn. I stand up and nervously recite the passage. Once I finish the teacher decides to use me as an example and starts listing the things I pronounced wrong and other things. She finishes off with what translates to &#8220;remember the mistakes he made when you recite&#8221;, which were directed at all the students who hadn&#8217;t spoken yet.

When this happened I was completely mortified and embarrassed. I avoided speaking aloud in class and in subsequent classes I would skip class just to avoid having to recite things.

In retrospect I didn&#8217;t mind being criticized by the teacher since she did that with everyone. But the way she put it like I was some negative example to watch out for, that&#8217;s what demotivated me. If the teacher hadn&#8217;t done that and instead used it as a way to teach me the proper way of saying things or told me to speak with her privately afterwards instead of in front of the whole class, I think I wouldn&#8217;t have been so demotivated.
