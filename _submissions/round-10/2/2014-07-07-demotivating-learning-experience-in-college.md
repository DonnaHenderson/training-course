Hi. A couple of facts before I start:

*   Public universities in Poland are free of charge. Students have to pay only when they re-take courses (for example when they didn't pass some course in a first year, they have to take it again in following academic year).
*   To pass the exam, students usually have three attempts: two in consecutive weeks, third some time later.
*   In case of spring semester: usually first two attemps are in June, the last one is in September --- due to the summer break.
*   Usually exams get harder with every attempt.
*   I've just made it through exam session ending my second year in a college.
*   Lectures usually are not obligatory in Poland.

My demotivating learning experience is very similar to [Emily's][1]. In my freshman year I had tons of Mathematics. I've always been pretty good at it, but for some reason I couldn't study well. I felt like something was blocking meâ€¦ My grades were really low, too. And I was having fun more than I used to in high school.

In the spring semester we had 4 exams. I didn't pass **any** of them in June/July. Thankfully I passed 3 in September.

The most demotivating was that feeling I got every time I received my grades. From every exam. Given the amount of energy I put into studying these subjects, I simply was devastated.

Even today I have no idea what was blocking me (my guess: seeing no effects despite how hard I worked). My following academic year has proved that I'm still a decent student and my grades make me feel fair: they're adequate to the amount of energy I put into studying. I have a good GPA (maybe top 20 students?). I "closed" this spring exam session with 6 exams at the first attempts and therefore **have 3 months of summer break**. I'm really proud <img src="http://localhost:8080/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />

What I can take from this and my later experiences:

*   less partying, more studying
*   it's worth attending lectures
*   if you can't study in your flat, maybe go to your university's library
*   studying with friends is really effective (I found that out too late!)
