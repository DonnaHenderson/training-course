I&#8217;ve remember one truly demotivating experience when I was attending climbing course on artificial walls. Before it I&#8217;d been climbing for a while and I&#8217;d got proper climbing course but I had not been good at technical climbing, my technique was mediocre. Therefore I went with my friends and colleagues to technical climbing course on artificial wall. Our instructor was great climber (in fact one of the best in whole country)Â and was used to train professional, semiprofessional and wannabe professional athletes and climbers, but not so often beginners and mediocre climbers as myself. My progress was not so good and shortly I started to not be able to do the most of new bouldering tasks, that coach prepared for us as difficulty of &#8220;climbing problems&#8221; was adjusted to the best in the class. I started skipping classes and became discouraged from trainings.

I think that the most important thing, that coach could do, it was to divide our group to two smaller groups and give second group easier tasks, in some of which we could succeed. Of course they should be on competitive, but lower level.
