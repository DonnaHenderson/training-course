I'm a PhD student at Macquarie Uni, Australia. I'm interested in large-scale ecological and evolutionary patterns. Currently I'm applying statistical and mathematical models to understand how the metabolic theory of ecology predicts patterns of biomass and abundance at different organisation levels.
