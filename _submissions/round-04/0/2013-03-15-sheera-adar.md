I am a postdoc in Jason Lieb’s lab at the University of North Carolina. I study DNA repair in chromatin, and my work mainly involves analysis of high-throughput sequencing data. I’ve never had any formal computer science training. I’ve (slowly) taught myself perl and dipped into R.  I’m still learning myself and enjoying it tremendously.
