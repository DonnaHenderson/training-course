I am an Evolutionary Behavioural Ecologist doing my PhD at Macquarie University (Australia). I use R heavily for all my programming and data analysis. I started programming during my MSc at the University of Guelph (Canada) where I was using Bayesian population genetic models to understand species diversity. I&#8217;m now getting into hierarchical modelling to understand the evolution of female polyandry and the quantitative genetic underpinnings of phenotypic traits.
