I&#8217;m an NSF post-doctoral fellow at University of Washington, working jointly between the astronomy and computer science departments. Â My research is at the junction of astronomy/astrophysics and large-scale computation. I&#8217;m active in the Python open source community, especially in the development and maintenance of the scipy and scikit-learn libraries.
