PhD candidate in Linguistics at University of Washington, Seattle, studying speech intelligibility, speech prosody (e.g., pitch & rhythm) and the listener advantage that comes from past experience of a particular talker&#8217;s voice.  Finishing in June 2013, then on to a postdoc to investigate perception of simultaneous talkers using MEG.  The code I write is probably 50% R, 25% LaTeX, 15% praat, 10% other (python, matlab, etc).  Before grad school was a graphic designer.
