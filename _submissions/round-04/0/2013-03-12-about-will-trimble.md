I was trained with a PhD in physics and did a three-year postdoc in laser atom trapping before switching fields to apply mathematics to the challenge of interpreting high-volume next-generation-sequencing data.Â  I&#8217;m now a postdoc in the metagenomic annotation group at Argonne National Laboratory testing working on validating analysis procedures and exploiting metagenomic data products.
