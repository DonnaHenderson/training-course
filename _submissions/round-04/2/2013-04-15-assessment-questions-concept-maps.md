Based on http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/04/01/concept-map-concept-map-2/

**Novice vs competent practitioner:**

1.  <span style="line-height: 16px;">What is a concept map and what do you use it for?</span>
2.  What do arrows and arrow labels indicate?
3.  What is the difference between a mind map and a concept map?
4.  Consider the question: &#8220;How does e-mail get from my laptop in the coffee shop to its final destination?&#8221;. Â Draw a concept map to outline the answer you would give a teenager.

**Competent practitioner vs expert:**

1.  <span style="line-height: 16px;">What advantages does a concept map provide to a) the teacher and b) the learner.</span>
2.  Discuss how prior knowledge and cognitive bins / structures relate to the use of concept maps.
3.  Bonus question: why would anyone ask assessment questions of a concept map of a concept map? <img src="http://localhost:8080/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
