These questions are based on Diego’s concept map.

**Beginner or Competent**

1 --- Identify a range of values from a series of steps leading a user through each of the different data classes and modes e.g.  get x from the 6th element in a vector, get y in the x'th item in row two of a matrix, get column q from the y'th dimension of an array? Convert q to a logical and identify the corresponding characters in a data-frame to spell a message...! etc etc...

I'm assuming the user has at least some basic understanding of how to handle data in R, and I think these are the kinds of simple tasks you  either need to learn, or should be comfortable with as a beginner or competent user.

**Competent or Expert**

1 --- Distils information from something annoying like a list or an array to create a bar graph using numeric factors, thereby encouraging them to see the necessity of conversion among classes, especially as with numeric data its not always obvious.

2 --- Similar to the above but there are NA's, NaNs and -9999's thrown in, as well as mixed characters in a single dataset that have to be cleaned out.

The difficulty here is that for such a core subject its difficult to find means of tester a users ability without incorporating other concepts not necessarily covered here. I'm struggling essentially to think of an occasion when you "break the rules". Nonetheless I think an "expert" should be able to rapidly identify what's required, where conversions are needed, how to sort the data and plotting is really just a formality in this case.
