I&#8217;m a big fan of courses overall. And this was a particularly good one. It&#8217;s easy to get into a mode of &#8220;this works well enough&#8221; with teaching. I think being forced to confront the evidence of how to teach is very, very useful. I&#8217;m an academic; I&#8217;ll probably never not teach.

**Round 4.1**

I found this a lot more useful than I thought. I think the hardest part of teaching is often where to start and what to include. I&#8217;ll definitely use these and either provide them to students or encourage them to make their own.

**Round 4.2**

This is something I&#8217;m still struggling with. I&#8217;d like to develop this more for the next time I teach my class so I can include it in my end of semester assessments.

**Round 4.3**

I actually really liked this. The book is jammed with good stuff. A little dry, but good stuff. And I&#8217;m a firm believer that you never know something as well as when you explain it to someone else. I often make presentations to organize my thoughts, and I find them very helpful. Glad we did this.

**Round 4.4**

This is just a tough one, overall. I did the screencast, and found that helpful. I might make a little series of those for my phylogenetics class and put them online so that I don&#8217;t have to explain 70 times how to change directories or scp a file. 

For my in-class, I did a short intro to using qrsh and screen for persistant instances of processes on a cluster. My video for the in-class teaching turned out super garbage (you can find it on my youtube if you really want &#8230; it&#8217;s bad). BUT &#8230; I can now see the people who were in the room connecting to nodes on our cluster via qrsh when I qstat -u &#8216;*&#8217; to see which nodes are in use. So mission accomplished. 

**Misc**

I&#8217;m not sure I loved the blog format, but I can&#8217;t really think of anything better. I do like the idea of these posts being publicly readable.

I think it might be a good idea to have a shared calendar or front page for the blog with a timeline of what is due when. I had a higher-than-usual travel volume this year, and it&#8217;s just easy to lose things when you&#8217;re all over the place.
