These questions are based on the lesson [Analysing patient data from Programming with R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/01-starting-with-data.html). 

Question 1 

Consider the following dataframe (dat):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dat <- data.frame(A=c(5,2,7,3,12), B=c(24, 102, 38, 48, 1), C=c(53,57,2,6,301), D=c(23,1,149,46,3), E=c(78, 34, 246, 2, 58))
print(dat)
```

Which code would correctly return the value 38. 

1. `dat[3, 2]`
2. `dat[c(3, 2)]`
3. `dat[2, 3]`
4. `dat[3:2]`

Question 2

Which code would give a mean value for each of the rows in `dat`

1. `apply(dat, 1, mean)`
2. `apply(dat, 2, mean)`
3. `rowMeans(dat)`
4. 1 and 3
5. 2 and 3

Answers to question 2:

1. Student does not realise that `rowMeans(dat)` does the same as `apply(dat, 1, mean)`.  
2. Student has mixed the value for rows and columns in the `MARGIN` argument, and has not considered `rowMeans`.  
3. Student does not realise that `apply(dat, 1, mean)` also retrieves the row means. 
4. Correct answer.  
5. Student has mixed the value for rows and columns in the `MARGIN` argument.
