**Which of the following codes will correctly reverse a string, i.e. word = 'Newton' to new_word = 'notweN'? Hint, you can start by assuming either of these conditions,
new_word = [] or new_word = ''**

a.  for letter in (word)[-1:]
        new_word.append(letter)
b.  new_word = word[-1::]
c.  new_word = word[::-1]
d. for letter in (word)[::-1]:
    new_word.append(letter)

**Reasons behind the chosen MCQs**

a demonstrates that the student have not learnt about how to solve this problem, but uses the logic that the list is being accessed in reversed manner
b demonstrates that the student vaguely remembers about the usage of double colon symbol (::) but might be confused where to use it
c is the right answer  
d shows that they have understanding of how loops work but have ignored the basic solution. However, This could also be a right answer when ''.join(new_word) was there, but this will return only the list of reversed letters
