These multiple choice quesitons are for [Python Math/Types](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/01-numpy.html) and [Storing Multiple Values in Lists](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/03-lists.html).

1.  Python Math/Types

apples = 10
oranges = '12'

What is the correct way to add the number of apples to the number of oranges?

a. apples + oranges
b. apples.append(oranges)
c. apples + int(oranges)
d. str(apples) + oranges



2. Python Lists (Multiple Items in Lists)

Consider the following code:
fruits = ['apples', 'oranges', 'bananas']
tangerines = (2, 9)
fruits.append(tangerines)

What is the output of print(fruits)?

a. ['apples', 'oranges', 'bananas', (2, 9)] 
b. ['apples', 'oranges', 'bananas', 2, 9]
c. ['apples', 'oranges', 'bananas', [2, 9]] 
d. ['apples', 'oranges', 'bananas'], (2, 9)


Explanation of distractors:
a) correct answer
b) Student believes each of the items in 'tangerines' tuple is individually added to the 'fruits' list.
c) Student believes 'tangerines' is a list.
d) Student doesn't fully grasp list structure - knows that 'tangerines' should be added to the end of the list, but fails to incorporate it into the list structure.
