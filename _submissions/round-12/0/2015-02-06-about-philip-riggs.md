I am a Technical Informational Specialist at the United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services, Veterinary Services. My Ph.D. is in GeoSpatial Science, although my scientific career began in limnology. Somewhere along the way I got involved with human epidemiology and I now work with animal epidemiologists, veterinarians, and ecologists.

My work focuses on using Python for data processing, data analytics, and data visualization. I do a lot of Extraction-Transformation-Loading of data for analysts that involves joining spatial data with non-spatial data. If I didn’t program for work, I’d probably still program just for fun. I also really enjoy drawing cartoons and tying fishing flies.
