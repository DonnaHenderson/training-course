#Javier García Algarra

I was born when [Ticket to ride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMxyK9azXR4) was #1, so I am a vintage guy. I am a telecom engineer 
at [Telefónica R&D branch](http://www.tid.es) and I have developed SW for more than 25 years. I hold a Ph.D. in Art History and I
am currently finishing the second one in Science, working in models of population biology at [UPM](http://www.upm.es). I found very
interesting the idea od Software Carpentry because scientific programming can benefit a lot of software industry best practices.
