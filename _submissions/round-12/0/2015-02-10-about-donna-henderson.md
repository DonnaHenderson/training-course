Donna Henderson is a 2nd year PhD student in Genomic Medicine and Statistics 
at the University of Oxford. She works with genome data to infer past population 
sizes and migration events. As a statistician working with biologists, she hopes 
to improve her ability to discuss and teach good coding practices. In her spare 
time she climbs, drums, and plays board games; none of them particularly well.
