[Sarah Stevens](https://sites.google.com/site/bactstevens/home) is a PhD candidate in the [Microbiology Doctoral Training Program](http://www.microbiology.wisc.edu/) 
at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.  She works in the McMahon Lab, using metagenomes 
and single-cell genomes to track microbial populations in two lakes in Wisconsin, 
Lake Mendota and Trout Bog Lake.

She is co-chair of [Molecular Microbial Ecology and Evolution (MoMiEE)](https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/momiee/), a group which 
facilitates discussion of methods among researchers at the University of Wisconsin - Madison 
who study microbial ecology and evolution.  MoMiEE also contains a Python study group, which 
Sarah also organizes.  Sarah is very interested in communicating science and teaching 
researchers computational skills.
