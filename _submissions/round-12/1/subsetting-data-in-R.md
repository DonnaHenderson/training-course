I focused on "subsetting" rather than "manipulating" because at least within my head I think of 
the apply function as a second logical step after subsetting--first *subset* then *apply* a function to the
subset(s).  I also used the dplyr tools rather than the base R ones because I find that beginners get less frustrated compared to with the equivalent base R functions like .
