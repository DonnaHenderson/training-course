During my studies in Chemical Engineering, one of the most discouraging stories that happened to me had to do with the MATLAB/Octave programming language. One of the most challenging subjects in this field is related to chemical reactors’ design. The use of numerical methods to model and simulate chemical reactors is mandatory to fully understand the nature behind this complex subject. So after a  successful first introduction to this topic (and MATLAB/Octave), I had a problem with the professor of the second semester.

The professor’s lectures were horrible. There was absolutely no structure other than a bad translated book and the programming classes were a real chaos. The grade depended on two marks:


Of course, after knowing my low grade, he explained me this “evaluation method” where his answer was that "I didn’t care about his subject because he did not know my face…"
