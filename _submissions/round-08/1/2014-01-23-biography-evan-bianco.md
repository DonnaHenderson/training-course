I am a geophysicist and I work as a consultant helping petroleum and geothermal companies predict the properties of the subsurface. I see my role being more and more of that of a technology steward, and have been piecing together a introductory course on computing (mostly Python) for professionals in my discipline. I consider myself a wannabe programmer, and I have been fairly decent at bashing things together to do some useful scientific computing.
