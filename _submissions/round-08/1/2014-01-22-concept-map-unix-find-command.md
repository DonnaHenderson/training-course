This is aimed at someone learning the unix environment for the first time. 'find' is one of those commands I use almost daily. I feel like this is too "flow diagram-y," and had a hard time breaking the command into its concepts.

Agreed, this is a mess. Here's my 2nd go at it. Trying to break how find works down to the 3 core principles: where to start looking, what you're looking for, and what to do once you find it.
