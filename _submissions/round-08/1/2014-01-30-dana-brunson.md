I&#8217;m director of the Oklahoma State University High Performance Computing Center.  I am interested in learning better ways to help people learn to use computational resources in their research.   I usually help people one-on-one which focuses on getting their immediate goals met, but that isn&#8217;t very scalable.

I learned about Software Carpentry last year and am very interested in learning more.  I&#8217;m still hoping that I can carve out enough time to participate fully.
