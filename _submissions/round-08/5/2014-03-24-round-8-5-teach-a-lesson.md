For our final exercise, everyone is going to:

1.  Choose a topic that they can teach in 10 minutes or less.
2.  Write that lesson.
3.  Submit it as a pull request to [our GitHub repository][1].
4.  Review other people&#8217;s pull requests, and respond to reviews of theirs.
5.  Once their lesson has been accepted, teach it live online.

We&#8217;d like people to pick topics by Friday March 28, and to have lessons ready to teach by mid-April, but we recognize that end-of-semester madness is coming up, so we&#8217;ll run the live lessons when and as folks are ready.

*   Rob Beagrie: doit (a Python build tool)
*   Evan Bianco: visualizing data elevation models
