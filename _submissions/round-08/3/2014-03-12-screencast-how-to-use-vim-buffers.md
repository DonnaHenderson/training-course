The screencast is about how to use Vim buffers to edit multiple files. This is my 3rd attempt. It&#8217;s quite hard to make the screencast for the first time. I had to learn how to use QuickTime for screen recording and my 2nd attempt failed because when I uploaded the video to YouTube, the bottom part was cropped out.
