I&#8217;ve spent the better part of the last two weeks (and some time prior) trying to come up with a MCQ that is related to the goals of SWC, namely that the question is related to computer science. Unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t been able to do so. This post is a collection of my thoughts from the past two weeks in hopes that someone might have some suggestions/help&#8230;

I keep coming back to the three different types of people: the novice, the competent practitioner, and the expert. Based on all that&#8217;s been presented so far, I find myself becoming self-aware. I&#8217;m cognizant of that I&#8217;m not an expert, and as such, I find myself struggling to try and place people in &#8220;bins&#8221;. In other words, how do I know if I&#8217;m overestimating my own knowledge? I know that I&#8217;m not an expert in any aspect of computer science, so how does one prevent his or her self from falling into the Dunning-Kruger Effect &#8220;trap&#8221;? I don&#8217;t necessarily agree deep down, but I keep convincing myself that in order to create a good MCQ that one must be an expert, otherwise you could easily be overplaying just how useful a particular MCQ is at assessing the distinction between a novice and a competent practitioner. 

Yeah&#8230;I&#8217;ve managed to wrap myself up into all sorts of knots&#8230;

Well, I don&#8217;t know how useful this is, but it stems from problems that I deal with a lot&#8230;

Question:

MCQ (novice/practitioner):  
Ryan has a list of temperature data for a given location, with many values repeating. Which data type guarantees all values are unique?

a. array  
b. list  
c. set  
d. tuple

MCQ (learn material):  
Ryan has a collection of unique numbers that correspond to observed temperature values recorded during the month of January. Ryan also has a collection of numbers that correspond to the number of times that unique temperature value occurred. What data type would allow a user to combine these two collections in a manner that would allow a user to quickly lookup the number of times a given temperature was observed?

a: dictionary  
b: list  
c: set  
d: tuple

Exercise:  
The following code snippet fails when executed. Modify a single line of the code snippet to allow the code to run.

=====  
grades = (&#8220;A&#8221;, &#8220;B&#8221;, &#8220;B&#8221;, &#8220;F&#8221;)  
grades[3] = &#8220;A&#8221;  
=====
