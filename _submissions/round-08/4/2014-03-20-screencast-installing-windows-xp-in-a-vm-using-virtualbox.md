Yes i know XP is unsupported now, but I still use it to run my SAS (entirely other discussion there&#8230;) and there&#8217;s a bunch of people I know with Macs that need it.

also for future linux users: simplescreenrecorder, audacity, and kdenlive are what I used to record the screen cast, audio, and stitch it all together.

I could&#8217;ve done a better job with the noise reduction from the mic, but I realized that too late. Â Also account for rendering times&#8230;

it&#8217;s way over the 3min mark. I was planning to speed up the entire video by 1.5x after i cut everything together, but that does not seem to be working for me, if anyone knows of a way to do that let me know!
