I had a couple of more interesting/original ideas for this screencast but it turned out to be impossible to get through them in 3 minutes. Even choosing something something very simple, I couldn't get through all the material I would have liked to cover. In the end I managed to get in formatting sqllite's output a bit more nicely, then basic use of count(), sum() and group by. I'm not sure whether even this was a little too fast, and I felt like I might not have explained the concepts well enough for a novice audience. I suspect in order to cover something well, I probably needed more like a minute and a half per point.
