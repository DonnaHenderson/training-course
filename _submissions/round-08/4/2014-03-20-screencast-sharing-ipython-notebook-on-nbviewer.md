A few experice dooing this screencast:

1.   Get a english localized computer people don&#8217;t read french in the menu.
2.  3 minutes is both too short and too long.
3.   Even if you think you will be alone in your office for at least 10 min that not true. 
    *   corollary: At least 6 major interruption happened in you office every hours, which make around 50/day.
    *   Remark: My headset isolate me from probably 4 out of 5.
    *   Conclusion; Steel Need to find a quieter place to write dissertation.
4.  Don&#8217;t try to do a screencast when you are sick and almost  can&#8217;t speak, even if 3 min seem short enough not to cough. You will eventually rip your lung out of your chest a few time before giving up. You&#8217;ll achieve barely something maybe a few hours before the SWC meeting.
5.  I&#8217;m more confortable discussing in english and having immediate feedback than speaking to nothing. Screencast are hard because you expect everything to be with perfect timing and no hesitation.

I&#8217;ll try to update that when my voice get better and add a more permanent link later.
