This assumes the student has already learned the basics of version control using git (add, commit, checkout, merge, status, log), and shows how to create a new repo on GitHub and how to push and pull changes to and from that repo. It also introduces the student to Markdown, although this isn't the focus.

I thought this screencast would take less than two minutes. I was shocked when my first attempt was nearly 7 minutes long. It took several takes to get this under 4 minutes, and now I'm not sure how effective it would be given its brevity and everything I had to take out.
