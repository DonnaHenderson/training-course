This is the result of my third attempt (attempt number one was too long, attempt number two had too many mistakes):



Creating the screencast itself was surprisingly painless, perhaps because I played around with some screencasting last summer and didn&#8217;t have to figure out any of the technical hurdles. Figuring out exactly what to say was harder &#8212; there are a lot of details that I could have mentioned (for example, I feel like I maybe didn&#8217;t explain git log well enough). I originally wanted to add both files and then have a third commit with a change to one of the files, but I didn&#8217;t have the time to do that.
