Hello! I wanted to do a tutorial that illustrates the power of using Matplotlib in an object oriented way, instead of the procedural way that most newbies to Python start with. I also wanted to touch on the notion of objects, especially for scientists who know about data and math, but may not have seen or used objects before. It seems to me that physical thing like a figure window and an axes within the figure is something that people can relate.
