As usual, it took longer to come up with a topic than to actually record the screencast. This is my 3rd take. On the first take I realized I called it &#8220;simple,&#8221; and having just commented to someone else that it is a demotivator, couldn&#8217;t leave it that way.

This would be aimed at an introduction to the command line, hopefully to demonstrate the power of a simple expression.

Viewing it is instructive, of course. Unnoticed (at the time) &#8220;ums&#8221; abound.
