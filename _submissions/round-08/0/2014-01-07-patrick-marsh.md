I am a meteorologist working for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#8217;s National Weather Service&#8217;s Storm Prediction Center. I earned my Ph.D. in 2013 at the University of Oklahoma&#8217;s School of Meteorology. Meteorology (and Climatology) is a field that is constantly in the news for issues related to reproducibility of research, and I&#8217;m hoping to help change my discipline&#8217;s culture by introducing good software habits.
