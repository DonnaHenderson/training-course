Hi everyone, I'm Stephen Turner. I'm an assistant professor in public health sciences at University of Virginia and the director of UVA's bioinformatics core (bioinformatics = using statistics and computer science to solve biological problems). The core is much like a consulting business within the university that provides bioinformatics data analysis as a service to other researchers.

I organized a Software Carpentry bootcamp at UVA last year that was very successful, and I'd like to be a part of bootcamps like this at UVA and elsewhere in the future.

I blog at http://gettinggeneticsdone.com and Tweet at @genetics_blogÂ on a variety of topics related to genetics, bioinformatics, and computational biology.
