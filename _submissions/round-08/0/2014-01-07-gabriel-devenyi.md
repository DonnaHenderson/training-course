I am a Ph.D. in Engineering Physics, currently working at McMaster University as a Research Engineer and Course Development Consultant on computational methods. My work is in experimental physics (The Role of Surfaces in Epitaxy), but I keep an eye towards automation of experimental and analysis tasks as well as best-practices for graduate student information technology use. My programming experience in self-taught in a variety of languages.
