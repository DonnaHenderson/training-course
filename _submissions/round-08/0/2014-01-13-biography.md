Hi, my name is Samantha, but most people call me Sam.

I was originally a Secondary School teacher (11-19yr olds) but am now an IT Trainer at University College London.Â  I deliver training in a range of software both standard office applications and more specialist technical packages e.g. SPSS and MatLab.

I graduated in 2003 from Kingston University with a 2:1 for BSc Computer Science and am currently studying part-time (distance learning) for MSc Intelligent Systems with De Montfort University (Leicester).

Why am I here? I attended one of the Software Carpentry Bootcamps organised by some of my UCL colleagues and thouht it worked really well and that it was something the training team could do, or I could do in the community in addition to aiding my understanding of the process so that I can better support in Bootcamp sessions at UCL.

Think that&#8217;s about it. Looking forward to reading your posts.
