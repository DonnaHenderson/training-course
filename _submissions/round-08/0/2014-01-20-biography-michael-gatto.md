I'm an expert in Web Micro-frameworks, Object-Relational Mappers (ORM) and templating engines for PHP especially, but also for Perl and less so, for Python.

I've been helping to build the web since 1997, when I had to build a unit webpage for our deployment, because no one else would. That pattern persisted until I was building full applications for the intelligence community because no one else would. I put my Marine Corps days behind me and went into Academia to become a software engineer full time.

My bond with software craftsmanship and carpentry came about from a strong desire to master the craft of programming and leave code better than how I found it, without upsetting those before me. Its quite a sensitive balancing act, especially in Academia.
