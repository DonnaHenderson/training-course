I'm a PhD student at Imperial College in London. I started programming in php as a web developer, and taught myself python and R during my master's so that I could apply programming techniques to my research. I work with several different sorts of next generation sequencing data sets in my graduate work and I'm really interested in best practices for managing, organizing and handling large datasets and also for doing research reproducibly (having learned the hard way what not to do...)
