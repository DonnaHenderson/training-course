I&#8217;m a PhD student at Imperial College in London. I started programming in php as a web developer, and taught myself python and R during my master&#8217;s so that I could apply programming techniques to my research. I work with several different sorts of next generation sequencing data sets in my graduate work and I&#8217;m really interested in best practices for managing, organizing and handling large datasets and also for doing research reproducibly (having learned the hard way what not to do&#8230;)
