I am currently lecturing of Mathematics at the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. I work with 1st year Engineering students who have been identified as having difficulties with mathematics. I am especially interested in using tools for visualizing mathematical data in areas such as bioinformatics. My previous life was in large-scale financial systems and database design. I also dabble in machine learning, functional programming languages and parallel processing.
