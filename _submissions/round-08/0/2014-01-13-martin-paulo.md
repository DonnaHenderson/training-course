I am a software developer let loose in the wilds of Melbourne, Australia. I currently work for the V3 alliance, a not-for-profit research service provider headquartered here. I have a very varied work history. From analysis of radar signals to the world of cash dispensers, from accounting to cloud computing: I have written software in and for all of these domains. As a software developer I am very interested in how we learn, and also, of course, in the ongoing soap drama that is my industry.
