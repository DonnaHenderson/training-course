I'm a cognitive neuroscientist, currently doing a postdoc at Penn State in the [Cognition, Affect, and Temperament Lab][1]. I study the brain systems involved in social-emotional functioning and development using neuroimaging, psychophysiological, and human lesion methods. I use Matlab, bash, R, and web languages (html, php, etc.) for data collection (presenting stimuli, surveys) or working withÂ data (managing/processing/analyzing). I've seen the importance of programming, but also the lack of training on programming in my field---so I am excited to help train other researchers in these essential skills.
