I&#8217;m an engineer, now in NYC, with a very varied background including work in semiconductors, a political nonprofit, and entertainment/media worlds. Over the years many beloved software tools have performed vital work for me, such as automated jobs for the day or production pre-press or yield analysis. Recently I completed the DevOps Bootcamp in Santa Clara CA. The Software Carpentry course has much overlap and I love teaching so I wanted to get involved.
