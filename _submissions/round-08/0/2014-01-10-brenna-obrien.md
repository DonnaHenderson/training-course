I am a front-end web developer with a background in math and physics. Â I've taught several day long workshops on HTML/CSS and JavaScript through [Ladies Learning Code][1], and I'm gearing up to teach a full-time front-end bootcamp with [HackerYou][2] in the spring. After learning from an outdated curriculum at a traditional college and a lot of self-teaching, I'm passionate about changing the way programming is taught and making it more accessible to a wider audience.
