I&#8217;m an associate professor of biology at <a title="King's College" href="http://www.kings.edu" target="_blank">King&#8217;s College</a> in Wilkes-Barre, PA. I teach biochemistry, genetics & cell biology on a regular basis, and an upper level systems biology class every few years. Getting my Ph.D. in an x-ray crystallography lab, I&#8217;ve been using the command line and *nix since 1994 and have always had an interest in bioinformatics. A position at the <a title="RCSB" href="http://home.rcsb.org" target="_blank">Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics</a> gave me a chance to learn basic python, and I&#8217;ve been a fan ever since. I eventually hope to offer a computational biology course at my college, but want to gain confidence in the computational teaching arena before doing so.
