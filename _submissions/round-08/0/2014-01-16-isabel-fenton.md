Hello, I&#8217;m Isabel. I&#8217;m currently doing a PhD at Imperial College London, looking at the changing diversity of ocean plankton through geological time (a combination of macroecology and palaeontology). I have most experience with R, though I&#8217;ve also used Python (and a very little bit of C).
