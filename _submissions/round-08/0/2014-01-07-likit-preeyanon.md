I&#8217;m a Ph.D. student at Michigan State University. I&#8217;m interested in <span class="GRcorrect">bioinformatics</span>,Â big data and programming. My research is focused on analyzing RNASeq data from the next-<span class="GRcorrect">gen</span> sequencing technology. In the past few years, I have been a TA in software carpentry workshop and other workshops that teach biologists to use a computer for data analysis.
