I&#8217;m an independent geoscientist in Nova Scotia, Canada. Originally from the UK, I founded [Agile Geoscience][1] in 2010, after working in the oil & gas industry in Calgary for a decade. Agile is a geology & geophysics consultancy in theory, but we also develop training courses for professional and student geoscientists (hence Software Carpentry), developÂ [web and mobile apps][2], maintain [a wiki][3], and [publish little books][4] about our profession.

I&#8217;m **kwinkunks** on [Twitter][5] and [GitHub][6] and <a>Gmail</a>. Nice to meet you.
