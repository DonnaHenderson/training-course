I'm an Android developer living in the Chicago area. The app I'm currently working on uses an Android tablet as the front end for some industrial equipment. 

Helping others learn has always been part of my job and something I enjoy doing. For some of my career I've even been a full time trainer. However, I'm a self-taught trainer so my education was by trial and error. I'm looking forward to developing an understanding of the principles behind learning so that I can improve the way I teach.

I've been following the activities of Software Carpentry for a couple of years and am super excited to finally being involved.
