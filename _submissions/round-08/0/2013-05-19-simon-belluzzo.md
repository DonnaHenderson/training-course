Hi everyone! I&#8217;m a MPhil student and one of very few bioinformaticians in the Dept of Microbiology and Immunology at University of Melbourne (Australia), and as such get many requests for programming assistance and instruction. I feel that computational science reproducibility, particularly in bioinformatics, can be greatly improved, and that teaching best practices is the best way to motivate that change.
