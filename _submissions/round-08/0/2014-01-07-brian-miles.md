I&#8217;m currently a P.h.D. student in Geography at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I am a graduate research assistant. Through my research I am exploring the role of residential stormwater management on stormwater pollution in Durham, NC and Baltimore, MD; I am focused on developing improved informatics tools for applying process-based ecohydrology models to urban ecosystem services.  In a past life I worked for four years as a web applications developer for the Computing Services division at Carnegie Mellon University, where I earned a B.S. in Information Decision Systems.
