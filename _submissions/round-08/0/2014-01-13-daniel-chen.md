Hi everyone.  My name is Daniel Chen.  I am currently a second year MPH student in the department of Epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health.

My background is in behavioral neuroscience, biology and computer science and I am currently working on agent-based models using the Repast Suite (java), natural language processing (in R and moving to python), and slowly learning the ropes Django.

I was a teaching assistant, where I held weekly lab/recessication sessions the past semester for the &#8220;quantitative methods&#8221; class, which is a combined epidemiology 1 and bio-statistics 1 course.

I was inspired by a bootcamp held Fall 2013 between NYU and Columbia (thanks Justin and David!), and hope to be able to bring computer science and scientific computing to the medical and public health community.
