I am a postdoc in the [Evolutionary Theory Group][1] of the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology][2]. I study game theory and evolutionary dynamics. Most of my work revolves around understanding how social behavior evolved. I use a combination of mathematical and computational models to account for the variability and complexity of behavior. As a computational scientist my background is pretty broad: before joining the MPI I did my PhD in economics, studying evolutionary game theory; before that I studied Computer Science, with a focus on natural computation. I was born and raised in Colombia. You can find more about my research on [my webpage][3]. See also my [github repo][4]. Sometimes I use [twitter][5].
