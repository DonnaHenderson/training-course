I&#8217;m running a small company [czterybity.pl][1] (in polish: four bits) focused on teaching C, C++ and Python. I&#8217;m cooperating with another small company &#8211; [infotraining.pl][2], but I&#8217;m afraid both web pages are currently polish-only.

I&#8217;ve got  PhD in materials science, preceded by MSc in physics but after quite long time as scientist in [IMIM][3] I have left academia. My experience as a programmer is based of my needs for data processing and visualization. But I have found (with sense of relief) that my colleagues were more interested with my programming skills than with my research in my main field. And I&#8217;ve found that I&#8217;m quite good at explaining ideas. So in 2006 I&#8217;ve started to conduct trainings, which is now my primary source of satisfaction.

I&#8217;m living in Kraków, Poland. I consider myself as addicted reader, never going out without some kind of book. I&#8217;m enjoying listening to good jazz music.
