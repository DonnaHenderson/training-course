I am a nuclear engineer who attended Penn State as an undergraduate and the University of Wisconsin as a graduate student. My research is on computational methods for neutral particle transport (i.e. where all the neutrons and/or photons are in a physical system). While at UW I participated in the creation of The Hacker Within, where a bunch of students taught ourselves about the tools we needed to do computational research.

I now work at a laboratory in Pittsburgh where I develop methods and implement them in software for my research group. In January I will be starting as an Assistant Professor at UC &#8211; Berkeley.
