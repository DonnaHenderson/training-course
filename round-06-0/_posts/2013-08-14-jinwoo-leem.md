I&#8217;m a DPhil/PhD candidate at the University of Oxford&#8217;s Doctoral Training Centre. I&#8217;ve only started to do programming year (mainly in Python, R, a bit of C) as I come from a biochemistry background &#8211; however, with biologists&#8217; increasing reliance on computational tools in today&#8217;s research, I feel that programming should now be an integral component for any biology-based degree.Â I know how overwhelming it can be for someone without any prior experience, and I am attending this training course to hopefully help those around me to learn to use programming as a key part of their work.
