I felt the set of videos provide a succinct and, for the most part, clear introduction to object oriented program design.

If I were to redo the videos I would make the following changes:

1) In the introductory comments section add links to a more in depth version of each item. That would allow viewers wanting a quick revision the ability to find info.

2) I would provide some examples of bad OO design &#8211; over abstraction etc.

3) I would develop the example of the fishes, snails etc. though the whole set of videos without the software aspects. This would give non systems people perhaps a better idea of how OO can simplify changes that come later / afterthoughts.

4) I feel the slides showing memory &#8220;layout&#8221; of various instances of an object too cluttered and not that helpful in clarifying the topic. I would find another way of illustrating the difference (maybe graphically) between various instances (objects) and Â each object&#8217;s attributes rather than in the context of memory.

5) I felt the description of the constructor and also that a class should be thought of as a collection of methods (behaviour) rather than a group of data to be particularly appropriate.
